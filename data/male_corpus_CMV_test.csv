"Al Franken went on Jon Stewart a few weeks ago and said it was ridiculous for a politician to be against a law that prevents students from bullying gay people.  Stewart's crowd ate it up. 

Stewart asked him what the Republicans said is their reason.  Franken dismissively responded, 'they don't believe anyone should be bullied'.  People laughed because well obviously LGBTQ people get bullied waayyy more than their counterparts so they need to be specially protected.

It seems pretty obvious you shouldn't beat up someone because they’re gay, but you really shouldn't beat up anyone.  While heterosexuals students may get beaten up a lot less on average, I'm sure we could identify groups within heterosexuals that should be protected from bullying, (e.g. nerds).  

Obviously adding nerds to the list of protective classes is ridiculous.  The LGBTQ community is considerably more organized and properly defined, they've banded together and pushed serious change in policy in the last decade.  In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Act passed on the same tune, a group banded together and they pushed for social change.

The issue with the entire concept of ""protective classes"" is that they only protect the ""alpha"" minorities while leaving everyone else in the dust.  Any group that can get national and consistent attention can get ""protected"".  It's exclusion masquerading as inclusion, it goes as far as to split the world into three groups, ""normal"", ""protected"" and ""fucked"".

"I'll be honest with you, I didn't even know about this whole thing until this morning. I saw a whole bunch of posts on tumblr like ""I hate Miley so much,"" ""Miley needs to check her white privilege,"" ""I respect Nicki so much for how she handled that.""

So I went on ye olde Google and in ten seconds found the transcript of the Miley interview, and I video of their exchange at the VMAs. So to recap, Anaconda didn't get nominated for best video, Nicki went on Twitter and basically said that it didn't get nominated because she's a curvy black woman and implied that if she were a skinny white girl like tailor swift (she never said nor implicated tailor, but tailor took it to mean her because she is a good example) she would have been nominated. Miley then says in an interview that she could have respected what Nicki said if it was said in a different less angry way, but couldn't because of the way she presented her points. She called Nicki ""not polite"" and ""not very nice"" in her statements about the nominations. Then during the VMAs Nicki said ""back to the bitch that had a lot to say about me in the press a few days ago"" then said something along the lines of ""what you got."" Miley then said, ""we are all in the same industry, we all do interviews, we all know how they manipulate things, congratulations on your award.""

Frankly before this incident I respected Nicki way more than Miley, but I've lost some respect for Nicki and gained some for Miley.

I think Miley's comments to the press were respectful, articulate, and accurate. I think she handled the VMA situation maturely.

I think Nicki's comments on Twitter came across as petty, and I also think they were inaccurate. I think the way she handled the VMAs was immature and only served to detract from her point by diminishing her credibility.

I also feel like Nicki and Beyoncé are two strong examples of non white women who are both celebrated for their contributions to the music industry and are regarded widely as extremely sexy. For this reason, I think that people calling it ""body shaming"" that Nicki wasn't nominated is ridiculous. She's a pop star and sex symbol, nobody is body shaming her, and if they are, not nominating her for an award doesn't count. I also feel like it makes sense that there aren't as many black women who are famous and receiving awards because, well, there are way fewer black women than black men, white men, white women, and all other gender ethnicity  combinations combined. Statistically it's completely reasonable for there to be years where an award with fewer than ten nominees have no black female nominees.

I do think Nicki has a point that black women and black men contribute a lot to pop culture and aren't recognized for it, but I think they aren't recognized because it's the average black person that creates more culture than a few celebs. We don't give out awards for ""segment of the population that most contributed to pop culture this year.""

I'm willing to award deltas both for objective proof that black women specifically are snubbed in the music industry (no subjective ""this video was clearly better"" nonsense), and for persuading me that Nicki's comments at the VMAs were justified/Miley was in the wrong in the situation in terms of the way she approached the problem.",{'men'}

"My proposition is that pronouns past the three most common ones are not necessary and are actively harmful. An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered in the wild is ""xe/xer/xerself"" or ""zi/zis/zimself"". My argument is as follows:

1. Pronouns are always dealing with a spectrum. A ""he"" can be used to describe both masculine as well as feminine men and similarly for she and women. The singular they is also covering a spectrum, the spectrum of all people that do not identify with either gender or those that identify with both to differing degrees. Therefore they is sufficient to describe alternative gender identities.
2. If we'd decide that new pronouns are necessary to describe or be inclusive to specific non-standard gender identities, we would very likely end up with a sheer infinite amount of pronouns. Since the argument for further pronouns would not be based on scientific facts but rather on feelings of individual people, the argument why some new pronouns are okay and others aren't would be a very difficult one to make. The result would be that we would have to allow anyone to pick or create their own pronouns.
3. Since we'd have a large number of new pronouns people would very likely get confused, since they'd not only have to remember a name and a face but also the specific pronouns of a person AND incorporate those into everyday speech. The result would either be that people would start inadvertently giving offence or our speech patterns would change to rely far more on using names instead of pronouns. 
4. Having a wide range of new pronouns would actively harm the English language by making it less clear. Encountering unknown pronouns would confuse people and make it difficult to imagine what kind of character is being talked about.

"I have this debate often with my roommate. He doesn't really have any strong theological beliefs (he's ""agnotistic"") but he believes there will always be more to our reality than what can be measured -- and, by extension, doesn't find it absurd for someone to believe in life after death. No matter what we learn about physics and the human brain, there could always be ""more out there"" that in some way would allow our being to persist even after death. This beliefs spills over into more practical matters, such as him refusing to see any computer as ever being ""conscious,"" regardless of it's complexity. 

I argue that we know enough in this modern age to dismiss that belief. We may not really understand how all the neurons on our brain work together to make a fully formed human mind, but we know it's an emergent property of physical parts -- and no more. We're a sac of complicated flesh that uses electrical gradients to process information. If one part of the brain is physically damaged, the processing that occurs in that area of the brain is disrupted. People have strokes and lose a huge chunk of their ""personhood."" Maybe they have trouble speaking, or recognizing faces, or maybe their personality is drastically altered. Regardless, it's clear that we're the product of PHYSICAL interactions in the brain. We don't exist anywhere else in any sense -- we are literally the structure of our neurons. It may be a black box, but just because we don't know how the black box functions doesn't mean there might be an entirely different reality out there that would allow our true ""soul"" to move to or extend from. It's just human arrogance to believe we're special in some way and can transcend this universe full of non-living parts. 

He also believes that we could be living in the Matrix, for instance, and that might be one way for life after death to occur. He says that I'm the arrogant one for claiming with certainty that we shouldn't believe in things beyond the measurable.



Edit: It seems like my main criticism is that claiming something with certainty (no afterlife) is inherently more ignorant that at least admitting something to be a possibility.

I'll try to rephrase. If we're abiding by a philosophical absolute sense of certainty, then anything is possible. The matrix is possible, god is possible... maybe there's only one sentient person on the planet and the rest are robots in disguise. You can't construct some logical proof to dismiss these ideas as being utterly impossible.

But where does this leave us? We can't know ANYHTHING, then? 
Just because all of our knowledge of the universe is acquired through inductive reasoning doesn't mean we can hold on to these irrational beliefs. We study the microscopic world that composes us, observe that everything seems to operate on static laws. We're composed of the very stuff we study, so, conclusion: we operate on the same static laws. If a 100 years from now we understand the brain in depth, and from static principles can explain how a given structure of neurons can give rise to a certain personality or behavior, then where will you put your theological beliefs? If we can be explained via rules in this world, why would i need to believe in anything more?


EDIT: I guess this entire discussion is about materialism. I'm a physicist at heart. I still view materialism / physicalism as the only reasonable philosophical position, but I'll retract the notion that people who believe otherwise are actually ""stupid.""

"A friend and I were talking about the current candidates and she couldn't understand why Trump was doing so well in the polls.  The best I could articulate it is that he is the most populist candidate out, his politics are moderate but heavily nationalist, his demeanor is one of our idealized archetypes, and he is wealthy but appears genuine, achieving a halo effect (unlike Romney.)  

After realizing this, I asked several other people, and realized that basically my friends, like Clinton, don't like how he communicates, but then have no major disagreement with the content.

Am I missing something?  Is there a good reason to dismiss him as a candidate?  More importantly, who is real competition for him?

EDIT
From todays conversations:
I see an argument for why he may not have a good chance in an election (delta awarded), mainly in that whatever percentage of his 25% popularity is republican is all he may get from the republicans, and as a more mainstream candidate arises, the split votes wont go to him (that is, the people who polled for him may be all that would poll for him in the primary, given any other more mainstream republican candidate.

However, I have seen no compelling argument for why he is not a populist candidate.  Some have tried to narrow the definition of a populist to being representative of a position or policies that in some fashion clearly serve the underserve or/and the majority, but this is difficult to define, and ignores the perception.  One person argued at length that the self perception of the constituency as victim and the candidate's policy being to address that sense of victimization is what makes them populist, and while I can agree that it is a fine definition, the person then asserts that this is not trump, and I disagree, as Trump clearly paints the American people as victimized by poor, self interested leadership, a corrupt political culture, and compromised ideas and strategies, and his entire platform is about going in as a normal private citizen and fixing it.

Many (most?) have simply tried to argue that he is too insulting to win, but I remain unconvinced that that would stop a sizable percentage of Americans from voting for him.  This is because Americans don't actually value formality and decorum as much as power and conviction.  For the same reason that this is the America we have, I can't see how a candidate, fundamentally in favor of current nationalist policies, but simultaneously harping on being free from big money interests and the many leadership deficits that are frustrating Americans, isn't hitting so many of the right cords with mainstream America.

If he sticks to a policy (rather than sentiment,) that is antithetical to a group, then another would be preferred by that group.  But a career politician vs Trump, both speaking in vagaries, I see Trump coming out on top rather consistently.  (Saw a headline today, Trump took a hit in polls for being in favor of higher taxes, this looks like an example of the very thing.)

If I get drunk and blow off all my money, it's my problem.

If I get drunk and get into a fight, it's my problem.

If I get drunk and have sex, it's my problem.

Of course, though, if you slip something into my drink and have sex with me, that's not my fault, and if you give me a drink and say it's Mountain Dew when it is actually something that knocks me out, it's your fault.

So if it wasn't concious and consentual, then it's still rape.

And if you were given it under a false idea of what you were ingesting, it's arguably still rape. (But if you say, oh sir I didn't know that alcohol makes you make bad decisions it's not rape)

worknman brought up something I didn't think to address, but I meant if someone says ""yes"" and has something in their body that they put in themselves that they knew makes them make bad decision, it's not rape. A drunk person can give consent if they consentually got drunk.

So also, if someone attempts to have sex with them and they say ""no"" and are too drunk to fight back, it's still rape, because they didn't give consent.

"Let's say we raise the minimum wage to $15/hr. Hooray poverty is solved!

But wait... What's to stop landlords (let's picture them as Mr. Burns) from calculating exactly how much extra everyone can pay now? Wouldn't the new cheapest place to rent be the maximum that a $15/hr wage could afford? I think people saying there would be less jobs is just fear mongering, but I would argue people making minimum wage would be no better off than they were before due to inflated costs of living if there are no limitations on those who set prices. And how fucked would you be if your current standard of living is based on making $16/hr, and suddenly rent prices raised like this? (You'd go from double the minimum wage to basically at the minimum wage).

If instead, we set regulations on necessary commodities (stuff you require to live like shelter) as a percentage of the wage of a minimum wage worker, wouldn't that make more sense? Free market works great for things people want, but not so well for things people need. For example, if the price of an Xbox exceeds what I think it's worth, I can simply live without one, demand will go down if they're priced too high, eventually the price will stabilize. But what am I willing to pay for a roof over my head? Heat in my apartment? Food on my table? Even if the price far exceeds what they cost to produce, I can't just decide to not pay for these things, so without limitations on what can be charged, what's to stop prices from going up indefinitely? (Looking at the US healthcare system, the answer seems to be nothing)

Last, but not least, does raising the minimum wage perhaps discourage skilled labor? If you're a person who's worked hard or went into student loan debt in order to attain a $15/hr job, isn't this the rawest deal possible for you? Suddenly everyone is making the same as you, minus your debt payments, having done none of the hard work you did? Suddenly you went from middle class to the worst off of anyone, all because you worked hard/got skills in order to get a better job. (I don't have a $15/hr job, but I know a lot of people who are in this situation)

So, what am I missing here? Would greatly value input of anyone with education/experience in economics, since honestly, the reason I'm asking this question is because I have very little knowledge in the area. 

TL;DR: I think raising the minimum wage would simply result in the cost of living raising to match, leaving minimum wage workers no better off and middle class folks worse off

"Some of you you believe the right to bear arms is inherent, my question to you is: ""how does it come about that this right is inherent?""

What makes this right inherent?

There is a difference between rights granted  by law and natural rights. Laws can define where natural rights are legally applicable. But laws can't give or take away inherent/natural rights. (Laws can, however, violate or protect those rights.)

There still must be a logical derivation of this right from nature if it exists.

If ""Natural law derives from the nature of man and the world, just as physical law derives from the nature of space, time, and matter."" my question is, how exactly is it that you are proposing the right to firearms derives from nature?

""It just does"" is not a sufficient answer.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights

Explain why we have the natural right to self defense, and how, logically, that right extends to include firearm ownership. Or the claim that gun rights derive from natural rights will remain entirely unsubstantiated.

I actually think guns are the least of our problems, and I'm not really a ""gun-grabber"" because there are a couple dozen things I'd rather do first. (And if those happen, guns would mostly only be used for hunting, and target practice. And the potential for a strong national defence, like they ought to be.) I'd rather get people educated and out of poverty. Etc. I tell you this so you can understand, I'm an open mind on this issue, and if you can't convince me, you probably won't convince anyone.

To be clear: I could give a  about gun rights, I don't see any logical derivation of those rights from nature. So far as I can see they are only legal rights and not natural rights at all.

At the same time, people who actually spend effort and time opposing gun rights annoy me, because (duh) there will always be weapons and violence until people get healthy and free. focusing actions on a wedge issue like guns serves to divide, and sow fear, rather than to unify and bring progress. Discussion, though, is another matter.

I am currently against both ""gun grabbers"" (practically) and gun rights (ideologically). So I am mostly heavily neutral on this subject. I have serious questions about the central dogmas of both sides of this debate.

Tell me why I should no longer ideologically oppose gun rights. Show the logical derivation from nature, which I believe you are claiming exists. currently without an understanding of the justification for the claim that gun rights are natural rights, It is my view that many legal freedoms or impositions are a matter of practicality, justified by the basic and overriding human drive to form a safe, harmonious, and productive society, and then that guns are simply impractical toward this end.

if you can't convince me of this, (or at least correctly formulate _any_ argument defending your position) , you are probably not really going to convince anyone.

But If your thought is that the right to firearms is derived from the right to self defend would it not make more sense that the natural right to self defend justifies the legal right to live in a firearm free environment. Since guns take more lives than they save?

To claim that a right is derived from nature without showing the logic of the derivation is equally meaningless as to claim that a right is granted by God.

I see no logical derivation from nature for the right of humans to bear arms. (Bonus: I can't imagine that there is any which wouldn't also ""justify"" the ""rights of monkeys to bear arms"".)

"I agree with most of Bernie's domestic politics, but foreign policy is a critical aspect of the presidency and I don't think he has what it takes. To convince me otherwise (and thus support Bernie), you'll need to show me I'm wrong about the following points, or that they don't matter:

1) I've never seen him not looking generally flustered and awkward. Working on international issues requires developing personal relationships, thus being good at making friends. I don't think he is like that.

2) It requires building alliance and persuading people. Bernie is an independent, does not have serious alliances or close friends in Congress despite being there for over two decades. He has not gotten any notable legislation passed. Would he really negotiate the best possible international treaties for the US?

3) A President needs to be able to understand and navigate everyone's goals. Bernie doesn't seem to try to understand everyone's motivations but rather just gets angry at people who think differently from him. e.g. he says things like ""I'll never understand why some poor people vote republican""

4) Being a leader involves standing up to or effectively dealing with bullies and thinking quickly. He has very little track record of doing this. And when the BLM protesters took his mic at his own rally, he just passively let it happen, seemed a bit bewildered.

"Had a thought about the disparity between mortgages and rent.

Two cases: Person A buys a property to live and every month for 20 years pays $1000. Person B rents a property to live and every month for 20 years pays $1000. While both persons paid the same amount, after 20 years person A could sell his property and have $240,000 returned.

I understand the importance of rent. Not every person has the financial backing to obtain a long term mortgage. However, there's something that seems wrong with the above. People of means can buy property and essentially have others (renters) pay the mortgage for them. 

While not a perfect solution, there's something that seems interesting that paying rent includes the requirement that .4% of the property ownership also transfers per month. Of course, the rent would be based in large part on the perceived value of the property and then also include costs that cover services. 

If a person had a 2 year lease, they'd own almost 10% of the property. During lease renewal, maybe the owner will want to buy that 10% back or the person moves and sells it to a higher bidder. It might not stop slum lords from forcing tenants to sell back their .4% ever month or other under the table dealings, though laws can be set up to protect against such practices.

Of course, property owners are not required to rent their property. However, there's something I like about the idea that if you let others use your property, you agree to give up a portion of that property as well as part of that exchange.

"Before I begin my diatribe about the Republicans, I must disavow the Democrats. If you look at my submission history(https://www.reddit.com/user/thankthemajor?sort=top), you'll find that my top content is in /r/Socialism. I am a Marxist, and the Democrats are sellouts. 

Also, by GOP, I mean elected officials and Party power structure, not voters. Now...

On every single issue where there is any disagreement, the Republican Party advocates and acts towards positions that are objectively harmful to the world. 

Environment

The Party politicians is just barely coming to admit that climate change is real. They certainly won't admit that it is anthropogenic.

The party opposes regulations on carbon emissions, which are absolutely vital to avoiding catastrophe.(https://www.climatecommunication.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/presidentialaction.pdf).

Despite Mitt Romney's rhetoric in 2012, the party stands opposed to advancing sustainable energy. They do, however, support environmentally dangerous fracking and the Keystone Pipeline, which represents a precedent for the extraction of ""unconventional oil.""

The real-world impact of this is huge. The World bank estimates that a 2 degrees C increase in mean global temperature will cause crop losses of 60% in South East Asia and 80% in Sub-Saharan Africa.

War

The Republican Party is the party of war. They are just barely starting to soften their tone on the 2003 Iraq War, and yet, in the same breath, they want to invade Iraq again. More than 100,000 civilians were killed in the last Iraq War.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War)

They unfailingly support expanding the military budget, even though it is bloated.

The GOP supports the decades long occupation of Palestine and all the human rights abuses of the Israeli military. They oppose the Iran nuclear deal, and thus work toward increasing the possibility than Iran will get a nuclear weapon. (Although, the Democrats are not much better on this.)

Human Rights

Except for the admirable dissent of John McCain, the Republican Party is the party of torture. 

They are the party of Voter ID laws, early voting elimination, and all the other practices that are the poll taxes of today.

They are still opposed to marriage equality.

They work at every opportunity to suspend women's reproductive rights.

They seem to think that transgender people are non-sincere perverts.

They almost all support mass deportation of undocumented immigrants from Central America.

They have started supporting the end of birthright citizenship.

Justice

They are the party of being ~~hard on crime~~ hard on criminals. Except for the honorable dissent of Rand Paul, they oppose extending voting right to those convicted of crimes. 

They are the party of the prison industrial complex.

They are the party of the police power structure, consistently supporting officers who kill unarmed black men and dismissing the BLM movement at every turn.

They oppose any kind of gun control, which we need to slow our ridiculous level of gun deaths.

Economy

This section does not need any explanation. Even more than the democrats, they are the party of the oligarchs. Poor people? Fuck 'em. Cut food stamps. If you're on wellfare, you're a leech. Cut taxes on the rich and raise them on everyone else. Shrink Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Healthcare is not a right.

TL;DR

On every issue I can think of, the GOP has the objectively more harmful stance. The world would be a significantly better place if they did not exist.

If one or more all-white towns were formed, some of the racists throughout the country would move to these PLEs. Because of this, there would be fewer racists in the rest of the country, and minorities would therefore be less likely to experience racism or discrimination.","{'he', 'his'}"
"I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying this was shameful, and embarrassing to the US military, a ridiculous simplification. To be clear, I am no fan of Huckabee, and I have nothing against our military or militaries in general. That said, I think he was dead on.

I think most people who don't accept this do so because they think it's crass, and brutal. Well, yeah, but it's also absolutely true. That's why the military has all those rifles and artillery and tanks and battleships and bombs and chemical weapons and knives and humvees and machine guns: for the killing of people and the breaking of things. Sure, not every member of the military's job is to be a killer, but those people are there to support the killers. The cooks, mechanics, engineers, and secretaries are all there to let everyone else kill people and break things as safely and efficiently as possible.

Again, I have absolutely no problem with this from a moral perspective. I am certainly not condemning anybody, just stating facts. Most people I've seen disagree with Huckabee are just dancing around this. ""Soldiers exist to protect the United States and her interests!"" Sure, using violence or the threat of violence. ""The army doesn't just kill people, they developed the Internet!"" Yeah, as a weapon to coordinate their violence in the most efficient way possible. The internet we have now is just an unintended side effect.

The US military is in a bit of a unique position, since they haven't had a lot of opportunities to do their job recently. Our military is so badass, there are not a lot of people with enough courage or stupidity to take us on. Thus, a lot of time is spent running practice drills and handing out food to people after earthquakes. That's great, but it's all a displacement activity until they need to do their real job. It's a sideshow, a distraction. The alternative would be these men sitting around, waiting for something to need destroying. We don't keep our military around and spend billions of dollars for disaster relief. We keep them around to kill people and break things. That's their real purpose, simple as that.

"So, first and foremost, I think it's unfortunate that the U.S. is one of the countries where both maternity leave and paternity leave are not universally granted by employers. But I think that if we were to put a place a law mandating employers to give paid maternity leave, it would result in unfair hiring biases against women. Some employers would develop a preference for hiring men over women because, if you are purely concerned with profit as lots of employers are, why take the risk of hiring a lady who might take a lot of time from work while you can just not risk it and hire a man? There are already a lot of stereotypes about women being less dedicated to their jobs than men because they are ""more focused on kids"". Wouldn't a mandatory maternity leave just make this worse? 

It's particularly unfair to women who aren't planning on having kids because employers could be biased against them for expecting them to use something they won't ever even need in the first place!

If paternity leave were also mandated, then this would be less of a problem because men would be as likely (or nearly as likely) to take leave as well, making the ""expected value"" of a man's labor to an employer the same as a woman's, and hopefully eliminating the bias.

"I've noticed that recently it seems like Americans (in particular) tend to look for reasons to be offended. One example would be race (yes I realize that racism is still a thing, and am in no way trying to minimize that terrible fact). 

There are so many things that can be directly attributed back to race or cultural upbringing, but when this is pointed out it is called ""racist."" I think that this is wrong and is making the race issue more prevalent than it needs to be. That sentence is not trying to suggest that the race issue needs to be ignored, merely that not as many people are actually racist as are being accused.

This same concept can be seen elsewhere, women for example. Women seem to look for areas in which they could possibly be seen as oppressed, even though it's likely that they are not being intentionally oppressed. For example, if a man suggests that a certain job would be done better by a man (which is IMO entirely possible for some positions) that would be seen as sexist an/or oppressive towards women. (To clarify, I'm not suggesting that women shouldn't speak out for their rights to equal treatment - I think that that is very important. I am suggesting that many women are looking for ways they could be offended and being the issue of sexism up in issues that have nothing to do with that).

I think that in America there is a growing ""desire"" to be offended, and that people tend to seek out areas in which they could be offended. This doesn't make sense to me, and I think that it brings up issues that have little to no relevance and actually perpetuates their prevalence.

Again, really not trying to sound offensive toward anyone with this post. I am aware that I only posted two examples, and I'm sure that I'll get some flack for mentioning only two groups of people - I apologize if I have worded something offensively, and sincerely promise that it was not intended to offend.

"Having played dota for 1 year, and Lol for 6 months before that i have come to the opinion that Dota 2 is a much better game in many facets. Not only is dota 2 completely free to play, the actual gameplay is better, and the graphics are much better.


-The Dota 2 map is larger and has more interesting features for vision and juking.


-Dota 2 has TP scrolls and a courier allowing for more interesting map movement.


-Dota 2 heroes have much more unique and scaled up abillities than LoL Champions.  Think techies vs teemo, and heroes like tinker, meepo, lone druid, invoker, etc.  LoL heroes typically have a couple skillshot nukes and a movement abillity as a rule of thumb.


-Denying, highground miss chance, and pulling/stacking make laning much more interesting in Dota.


-Ancients and Roshan are much more interesting high value targets than Dragon or Baron.


-Towers are much weaker in Dota, and smoke of deceit exists, allowing for much more aggressive gameplay.


-Dota heros are much more turbocharged, any dota hero ported exactly would be the strongest champion in League of Legends.


-Activatable items improve gameplay decisionmaking.  LoL items are boring and mostly just stat based.  Dota items allow for much more customizablility in item build and improvement in game play (blink dagger 18 second cooldown vs. flash 300 second cooldown).


Dota 2 has a higher barrier of entry in a style of game whose focus is improvement, and that might lead people to LoL, but given the massive time investment in either game this is basically irrelevent.

"I'm not saying monogamous people do not deserve relationships, to the extent that they simply don't want other partners. If a person doesn't want another partner, that's okay. Most of the time, I also don't wish for any other partners than my wife.

What I'm saying, however, is that people do not deserve relationships to the extent that they want to impose monogamous restrictions on their partner.

As a society, we do not recognize agreements that attempt to take away a person's individuality. If you enter an agreement where you willingly become a slave, we do not recognize this. If you enter an agreement where you become an indentured servant, we do not recognize this.

Similarly, when you say your marriage vows, and make an implicit promise that your genitals will only ever touch your partner's, this is giving away individuality. Legally, this promise is not enforceable. We do not recognize it.

What I'm saying is that we need to go beyond just a legal position, and recognize that morally, also, these promises should not have our respect. It is not moral to relinquish individuality.

If two people do not want other partners, that is great. They should be able to have a relationship that does not involve anyone else. But there should be no expectation, from either partner, that this state of affairs will continue indefinitely. The two partners should enjoy such a relationship as long as it lasts, and not attach strings.

At no point should a person expect from their partner to never want to be intimate with anyone else, and at no point should a person make their partner promise such a thing. Such an expectation is immoral; immature; insecure; possessive; jealous; and selfish. Such a promise keeps these non-respectable qualities even if, at one point in time, the promise and the desire to make it are mutual.

0. You're ignoring that monogamy works fine for so many people!

I'm not ignoring that. If monogamy works for you, do it. However, I am saying that the proper way to do that is by being monogamous yourself; not by holding someone else &amp;#8211; your partner &amp;#8211; to a strict monogamous expectation.

If monogamy truly works, long-term, both for you and for your partner, you will walk into it by happenstance. If that happens to you, nothing is wrong with it. Just don't try to make that happen with coercion.

1. Society is based on contracts; employment agreements also encroach on individuality

 When you sign up for a job, you agree be at a certain place, awake and sober, and perform tasks for hours on end regularly in return for money.

As an employer, I take steps to maximize my employees' individuality. My agreement with them is that they're paid for actual work they do (they are software developers), and I pay them handsomely for the work that is done well.

I make no requirements encroaching on them that are not absolutely necessary. Everyone works from home, and can have an environment they like. I do not require certain hours to be kept. I make no impositions on their drug use or sobriety. I make no imposition that they cannot quit their jobs at any time, and go work for a competitive company.

This is because I believe work should be truly voluntary. I think the companies that practice these encroachments are in fact being immoral, and are exploiting negotiating leverage. I do not wish to be that type of employer.

I believe a large portion of our world, of our economies, is based on subtle slavery. I believe we should be acting to change this, and the first place to start is with intimate relationships that ought to be loving.

 Society doesn't work if everyone goes around doing whatever they want all the time, 

To a large extent, we are vastly exaggerating the encroachments on individuality that we believe are necessary, and should be reducing these encroachments in all areas, both intimate and in employment.

2. I also expect my partner to be financially responsible, to travel with me, to not do drugs.

Expecting your partner to generally be financially responsible is one thing. But blowing up when they've purchased this one item that seems unnecessary to you is another.

Wanting your partner to share your interests is one thing. But blowing up when they don't want to travel with you to this one particular country is another.

Expecting your partner to not smoke pot all day, and your home to not be full of smoke, is one thing. But blowing up when they've had a joint with a friend this one time is another.

Similarly: expecting your partner to mostly be available to meet your needs is one thing. But blowing a gasket because this one time they flirted / kissed / had safe sex with someone is another.

-----

3. Expecting a person to not be intimate with others; and expecting a person to tolerate such intimacy; are the same type of coercion.

Only to the extent that a cartoonist drawing Mohammad, and a fanatic calling for beheading in response, are the same type of insult. The drawing is not even an insult, unless you choose to interpret it that way.

The pain of a Muslim who saw a drawing of Mohammad is self-inflicted, and rooted in unhealthy beliefs. The pain of a person whose partner was intimate with someone is similarly self-inflicted, and rooted in unhealthy beliefs.

When a person physically stabs you, it's their fault. But when it feels like you're being stabbed because your partner wants to express their love or lust with someone else, you're not being hurt by them. You're being hurt by jealousy and insecurities that you have not overcome, but can.

This is your pain, which you don't need to feel; and would not feel, if a sick culture wasn't telling you that you need to. Just like the pain of the Muslim seeing a drawing of Mohammad is a pain he doesn't need to feel; and would not feel, if his own sick culture wasn't telling him he needs to.

You may think this comparison is unfair and hurtful because Muslims who call for beheadings are obviously crazy, as opposed to you. But do you think those Muslims believe themselves crazy? They think they're justified &amp;#8211; as do you.","{'he', 'him', 'his'}"
"Before I begin, I would like to clarify that my definition of the word whore/slut/tramp and the like when I was growing up meant a Woman/Girl who had a lot of sexual partners, (not the other definition, which means to have sex for money) and this is the definition I will be discussing here today.

A person's view of what sex is and how it should be done is different for everyone. Some see it as just a casual thing, others a sacred act. But in the end, I doubt anyone would dispute the claim that a desire for sex is one of the most natural things about being human, secondary only to wanting food/water/shelter, and on equal standing to a desire for life fulfillment and companionship.

So why then, is having sex with a lot of people viewed as bad? Especially when you're taking the proper measures to make sure both you and your partner are safe, and you are not going to produce an unwanted baby....

Women in particular are the ones who get this sorta flack the most. It's very easy yet also extremely nasty to call a fellow girl a whore/slut/tramp etc when you want to discredit her. It's implied that a woman is somehow dirty or is a low life or what have you simply because she chooses to have a lot of sex.

But what happens when a guy has a lot of sex? He get's applauded for it. It's seen as him ""just doing what guys do."" It's almost like it is encouraged. Even gay guys like myself don't get flack for having a lot of casual sex (we get shit for a totally different reason lmfao) but generally our straight allies don't tend to question our behavior all that much. At least, from my experience..

So why is it bad for a girl to have a lot of sex? I get that girls sexual ""wiring"" is different from guys as they generally leads to them having different/lower sex drives. But when a girl DOES have a high sex drive, and doesn't want a relationship, WHY IS THAT BAD?

Footnote: Any girls out there reading this who like having lots of sex GOOD FOR YOU MAN. I support you.

"To be honest, I'm not sure I completely believe in the title opinion statement. The issue seems really complex to me, but at the moment that is what I think. Currently, the migrant crisis is one of the biggest items of concern for Europeans. Most Europeans say, with much accuracy, that the migrant stream has to be shut off because a) immigrants are a weight on the economy, and b) most migrants refuse to assimilate, creating a lot of social problems. However, I still feel like they have to own up to that problem. Western societies historically engaged in colonialism and imperialism and profited over it so much, that they achieved wealth that continues to earn their country the status of ""developed/first-world."" Often times when they did this, they ended up creating conditions in the colonized country that would be unfavorable to their future development. I know most Europeans/Americans would respond to this by saying ""I had nothing to do with this, why should I take responsibility over the past?"" but I find that to be a really weak argument. If my grandfather robbed somebody of something, died, and passed the stolen goods/money down to me, don't I have a moral obligation to return the stolen items, even if I had nothing to do with the crime? I think I would. Maybe the main problem with my view is that it is purely moral, and not legal/practical. But letting poor people work out the problems that are partly as a result of your people's past seems very selfish to me.

"Let me preface this by stating that I don't believe in judging, shunning, or harassing people because of who they are, I just don't know why their choices are a thing to be celebrated and supported?

Stories:

 I was walking down the street in a large city and there was a homeless man sitting in a corner mumbling about how he was a starship flying through space.  I pitied him, as he (seemed) to genuinely believe that he was an actual starship, and assuming no drugs were involved, I expect most of society also does.

 A young man who frequents a card shop I visit believes himself to be a wolverine.  Not the marvel superhero, an actual badger-like creature indigenous to the Adirondacks of upstate New York.  Most people treat him rather poorly, as he acts like a wild animal fairly often, but I also pity him as he truly believes he is a wolverine.

 A previously homosexual, previously male friend of mine recently came out as ""trans"" meaning that he(now she) would like to live life as a woman.  Society seems to say that this should be celebrated, that this is a brave and good act.

I view all these 3 stories as on the same spectrum and should be treated the same.  Either we treat all three as varying levels of delusion/mental illness, or we work as hard as we can to make those people feel right in society.  All three people think they are something that they are not, so I feel that societies responses should be consistent either:

1. Treat all 3 cases as mental illness.  Realize that mental illnesses exist, and if there is no cure, it is something that must be managed, just as with bi-polar, multiple personality disorder, etc.

2. Celebrate this, and have the person live their lives in their own manner.  My male (now female) friend can live and be treated like any woman, that young man (now animal) at the card shop can live and be treated like a wolverine, and that older man (now starship) can be free to pursue a career at NASA as a test shuttle or whatever. (It's an extreme example, so the metaphor doesn't quite hold up)

Now I have no problem with any of the three people.  None are hurting anyone, and unless they are disrespectful I have no qualms about interacting with any of them.  But why is being a ""Trans woman"" (used to be man) so much more acceptable than any other form of delusion?

"I hear a lot about modern feminism being closely related or even incorporating LGBT+ into itself, and this makes very little sense to me.  


Equality of opportunity can only truly exist if male and female people are perceived as equal in every way as long as  humans and inherent human bias are still factors - this is one issue I have with Feminism in general, but not the point of this CMV. My view is that this directly contradicts the very idea of transgenderism and even to an extent homosexuality in that it removes the unorthodoxy in interaction between gender in non-traditional ways not via acceptance, but by unifying the genders.

 
Ideally, in a feminist world as I see it, genders would be identical in interaction both socially and in work, and biological sex either disregarded or put onto a 'spectrum', in which case transgenderism could be considered a purely cosmetic change (which would be undesirable to undergo seen as the perception of you would not change despite the effort you put in). The current reason as I see it is that they fit better into their reassigned gender roles, which I respect, but gender roles would be eliminated by many feminists, given a chance.

Beacause of this, I see transgenderism as either meaningless in the context of Feminism, or a stepping stone for a pseudo-Orwellian future of counter-constructive normality.

"Firstly, my heart goes out to the victims and by no means am I making excuses or defending any actions. Yesterday's events were a tragedy. Having grown up on Smith Mountain Lake and spent countless days on the very docks that the incident took place and having gone to the same school as Alison, the events hit really close to home. May Alison and Adam rest in peace.

Secondly, I am not coming from the pro or anti gun legislation perspective. If I could remove all guns from the world and safely fill the sport and personal self-defense gaps with something else with a single wish, I would... after I wished for $1 billion and 22 year old Heidi Klum to be my wife. I wanted to talk specifically about premeditated murder and the role firearms play in them. 

While watching the comments role through in yesterday's /r/news thread, several comments mentioned the desire for tougher gun laws. However, I believe that in instances of premeditated murder (vs manslaughter or random acts of violence), tougher gun laws would not prevent these events. 

I am going to repeat myself a few times, but bear with me: 

Despite all of the reason for Bryce Williams not to commit yesterday's crime, he still decided to go through with it. Despite the consequences that he would face legally, he decided to go through with it. Despite the pain he would cause to the families of the Alison and Adam as well as his own, he decided to go through with it. Despite the hate and vitriol his memory would leave, he decided to through with it. Despite all of the reasons not to go through with it, he decided to go through with it. 

My argument is, if guns were more difficult or impossible to get access to, Bryce Williams would have just added it to the list of hinderances he ignored and still gone through with it. Hypothetically not having access to a fire arm, I believe he would have still gone through the act of trying to kill Alison and Adam by another means. 

I so badly want to believe that we can prevent incidents like yesterday's from happening through tougher gun legislation or any other way, but I cannot see how. Please change my view. ","{'he', 'his'}"
"A journalist's job is to report the news, not to create them. Ramos made himself a news item when he trolled presidential candidate Donald Trump during a press conference. Political statements, being unruly, and making accusations does not constitute journalism and not why Univision sent him there. The press conference was not there to allow journalists to express their feelings about issues.  After such unprofessional behavior became public and a national news item, Ramos should've been fired immediately.

I'm not a fan of Trump, I would not vote for him, and I don't think he'll get the nomination.  However, whether you hate him or not, trolling a presidential candidate during a press conference is an embarrassment to the nation, makes a mockery of out our democratic process, and coming from a journalist, should lead to a dismissal.

If we instead agree that trolling presidential candidates is OK if they had it coming, then it opens the floodgates to anyone who dislikes a candidate to disrupt our democratic process. Who decides when a candidate can be disrupted or not?

People mostly agree that the activists who disrupted Sanders were out of line, but when it's Trump, it's ok?

"This view of mine might sound obvious or simple but I think a lot of sensitive, complex social issues have simple underlying causes that are often ignored. In fact, I think they are so often ignored that I start to doubt my own view, hence this post. I'm a little embarrassed to share it. Here's my basic line of thought:

 Stereotypes exist because the generalization is accurate.
 Several of society's popular problems are blamed on other people acting with an awareness of stereotypes, or the stereotypes themselves.
 A lot of cases regarding these problems are caused or made worse by the victim acting in accordance with a stereotype while blaming either the stereotype or something else.
 If people made more of a conscious effort to not act in accordance with a stereotype in a situation where the stereotype could be considered relevant less incidents would occur.
 When less incidents occur the stereotype changes or evaporates completely. 

'Victim' is somewhat of a loose term here (I'm excluding people who are indirectly involved with an incident pertaining to whatever social ill anyone might refer to) so before you shout ""victim blaming!"" I'll freely state that yes, I believe victims are very rarely 100% free from some kind of responsibility. 

An example would be a black man being pulled over in a bad neighborhood and getting ticketed, arrested, or worse after arguing with/ resisting the police officer. We might be able to argue the man was unfairly profiled, but we can't prove something like that. It's much easier to take preventative measures (respect and compliance with the officer, no matter how shitty of a person they may be) and either avoid the situation completely or not make it harder than it needs to be. But once the black driver starts getting loud and upset, in the cops mind he's just another loud black person (fulfilling the stereotype) which could lead the officer to believe that the driver fulfills other aspects of his stereotype. 

Another quick example would be the stereotype of men only being interested in sex and men saying ""not all men are pigs."" Well, if that stereotype upsets you as a man, the only thing you can really do that will have any kind of effect is to not be a pig! But nobody seems to realize this, they just want everyone else to do what they ask. 

Obviously I'm not proposing an over-night fix to any social issue, but what I'm proposing would benefit our society a lot more than victims telling everyone else to stop stereotyping. Pointing the finger at the aggressor(s) doesn't actually help solve the whole problem; all that does is either end that individual incident or piss people off. That shortsightedness does absolutely nothing to solve the problem on any kind of large, lasting scale. 

I'm happy to edit for any needed clarification.

"I don't want to live in the USA anymore. I never really did. Only thing here for me is friends and what tiny family I have. If I had the resources and the guts to leave everything behind, I would leave at the first chance I am given. Here's a list of reasons why I believe the United States is unfixable, and the only thing left to do is jump ship:

 Education is based on test scores and Scantron test bubbles, not how well any given student is learning. Privatized education is stealing from public education funding, resulting in crumbling public schools and a wealthy elite private school system.

 There is no living wage, minimum wage is a joke ($7.25/hr) and some places even get away with customers paying for a worker's wages (tipping at restaurants, hotel valets, etc). Corporate profits are at an all time high and barely increasing, if not decreasing.

 Student Loans are out of control, absurdly inflated while students are having a harder and harder time finding work. Textbooks are overpriced and updated minimally for easy revenue when the latest version is required with little content improvement.

 Media reports on nonsense until a tragedy, violence or a corporate agenda is at hand.

 Police Force is over-militarized and over-protected. Police unions make sure officers are treated with impunity, even with sufficient evidence and contradictory eyewitness reports. Police brutality is not going away.

 Drug War is a war on the people. Addiction and abuse is punished criminally instead of treated as a mental illness/condition. Tax money is lost on illegal drugs traded by armed criminals, promoting cartels and black markets.

 Prisons are over crowded with non-violent offenders and poor Americans who couldn't pay ridiculous fines or fees. For-profit and private prison systems are an atrocity, some even enslave prisoners for manual labor. Guantanamo Bay is a violation of human rights.

 Politics are corrupted and solely motivated by money. Lobbying is out of control. Campaign donations are essentially legal bribes, and corporations and mega-companies have to much political influence.

 Military has an immense budget while producing useless, unneeded weaponry and equipment. United States fights unnecessary wars and infiltrates and overthrows peaceful governments.

 Gun Control needs reform. Mental evaluation and criminal background checks need to be performed thoroughly before any firearm can be purchased or acquired.

 NSA spying and the surveillance state need to be dismantled. Huge swaths of data is being collected, stored waiting to be misused. Spying on its own citizens and allies violates human rights. The TSA needs reform, right now it's a useless taxpayer void, where useless machines and invasive procedures are becoming more and more prevalent.

 Copyrights and patents are creating turmoil for startups and new ideas. Large companies consistently and deliberately misuse and even change copyright laws to benefit themselves, while stifling innovation and hurting people's rights to free information.

 Net Neutrality, free trade and personal privacy is daily being eroded and constantly in danger: SOPA, CISPA, Trans Pacific Partnership, PATRIOT Act, PIPA, Special 301 Reports(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_301_Report))

 Social Security has been abused and taken advantage of by the Baby Boomer generation. The retirement age is ever increasing beyond what should be considered normal due to technology and computers, taking up jobs from younger people looking for work. Saving for retirement is becoming increasingly difficult.

 Wall Street and the Big Banks steal/lose/launder trillions while facing little to no punishment, in the way of fines or breaking up the companies. Instead, these banks are bailed out by the government using government loans, causing inflation, devaluing the dollar, and increasing the national debt. Don't get started on predatory interest rates and payday loan schemes.

"I'm not entirely sure if I agree with the ""no attention to the gunmen"" philosophy after tragic shootings. I think we can all agree that a major part of the problem is mental illness, and as hard as it may be to forgive someone for an atrocious crime like this, we have to understand that the shooter's reality is far far different from a normal reality. As strong as the urge is to call the shooter a piece of shit, I believe this behavior will only further alienate mentally ill and perpetuate the ""us vs them"" mentality they have. Contrarily, if we looked past the (albeit powerful) urge to dismiss the shooter as inhumane and instead welcome them to forgiveness and treatment, it may be an important step in bridging the disconnect between the mentally ill and mentally healthy; it may also prompt the mentally ill to seek help early before the illness becomes uncontrollable.

Edit: Many of the replies focus on the media glorification of shooters, turning them into ""celebrities"". I should have been more clear that I do NOT believe this is productive. Rather, I believe that completely ignoring the shooter from media is also unproductive in that the media (instead of focusing on the bizarre ideologies of the shooters) should instead focus on the mental illness aspects, warning signs, and appropriate means of intervention. Only in this way can the root cause, mental illness, be addressed and not just ignored. This would then shift the ""celeb-dom"" paradigm to a mental illness paradigm, which I think is important for both the general public and the confused people who are considering committing such acts. 

Edit 2: By warning signs and intervention, I clearly don't mean in the face of an ongoing shooting. I mean beforehand. Regarding this most recent case of the journalist and cameraman, I read that the news staff unanimously noticed odd and hostile behavior from the now-shooter and their response was to fire him. While firing him entirely justifiable since his behavior was interfering with his ability to perform his job, perhaps this odd and hostile behavior deserved some recognition, discussion, and possible intervention? I wouldn't know specifically what, since I'm not a practicing psychologist/psychiatrist, but if his behavior was peculiar enough to warrant removing him from his job perhaps an expert would agree that this is a sign that intervention, or some type of discussion, is appropriate.

"I see nothing wrong with polygamy. The only problem I could see occurring in polygamous marriages is the destruction of traditional marriage, however this has been argued to have been a problem with same-sex marriage. Like same-sex marriage, I can see no ethical dilemmas brought upon by introducing polygamous marriages besides the religious. Our nation is not built upon religious foundations, we are a secular state, therefore using Christian morals to argue what is marriage what is not is not a viable reason to keep polygamy illegal. Prior to European colonization (headed by Christian leaders), many cultures from around the world practiced polygamous marriages for thousands of years. Now after decolonization, this has been shrunk to mostly the Middle East, Indonesia, West Asia, Myanmar and most of Africa.

There have been some that have argued in the past that polygamous marriages have a higher rate of abuse of women. However, if we look at who is practicing polygamy and where it is currently legal, can we truly say that the type of marriage is at fault? Most (if not all) nations where polygamy is legal are Islamic nations. The religion in and of itself is not known for being respectful towards women nor tolerant of them deviating from the wishes of their husband (or government). Can we truly say that abuse would become less prevalent in Muslim countries if all marriages were suddenly turned to monogamous ones? Others will point to certain cults that have split off from the main Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and speak of their abuse against women and even rampant pedophilia. This is once again a bad example. Who in the United States is practicing polygamy? More often than not; cults. Cults are often cults of personality, the worship of a single person; the cult leader. Can we expect a person who has made themselves out to be something of a prophet (or more) to respect their spouses or basic human rights? Probably not. Let's think for a moment and say that a nation like India happened to be the first to legally same-sex marriage. If there was a high amount of abuse among marriages, surely this would be seen in gay and lesbian ones as well. Could we then not point to India and exclaim that same-sex marriage simply does not work?

Some argue that there are simply too few people interested in a polygamous lifestyle for people to protest its ban or for legislation to be passed to overturn it. This is true, however it does not change the absurdity of being against it. Many things are legal (or are simply not illegal) that few people practice. Does that mean that they should be illegal because they deviate from the norm?

This is does not exclude the possibility of non-abuse marriages by non-Islamic, non-cultist polygamous marriages. There has been the concept of non religious marriages involving multiple partners for men and women since the hippy era of the United States.

We are a free society, a free nation. Why should we decide how many a man or woman chooses to marry? Who are we to deny these marriages? Are we so morally superior that we can dictate that marriage must be between two individuals? I do not see the appeal of polygamous marriage, however I do not see myself as one to judge.","{'prophet', 'men', 'husband', 'man'}"
"The only reason that looking good/cute/attractive is important to women at all is because men have spent thousands of years coercing them into believing that looks are an important part of being a woman. No matter what your conscious reasoning, you cannot escape the fact that the reason you care about looking good at all is because you were raised in a culture where it is practically screamed in your face every day that ""A GOOD WOMAN IS BEAUTIFUL! A GOOD WOMAN IS ATTRACTIVE!""

Therefore, when a woman claims that she dresses/makes up so that she can feel good about herself (as opposed to doing it to please/attract men), it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what you claim because the end result is the same: you ARE pleasing and attracting men, and you are valuing yourself based on attractiveness. It doesn't even matter if you're not straight. You are doing what the patriarchal system has dictated to you that you must do, and in so doing you are reinforcing that system. After all, isn't it a mighty big coincidence that the thing you 'want' to do just happens to line up perfectly with what the system wants you to do?

DISCLAIMER: I am not judging women who dress/make up. I do not care what you do, but I think this is an important distinction that must addressed, because the closest you can get to choosing for yourself is acknowledging the motivation for the choice (the part you can't control) and accepting it for what it is.

Zoos and aquariums give people an opportunity to see animals up close in a way that they never would otherwise. The experience of seeing a Mountain Gorilla on the other side of a pane of glass is far more incredible than simply watching Animal Planet.

Having the experience of seeing an Orca swim by and be in awe of their power and intelligence is not the same as seeing one in a Youtube video.

I remember when I was a boy my parents took me to the zoo. It was when I saw lion up close that I decided then and there that I wanted to be a wildlife biologist. Now, life took me in a different path and I never arrived at that career, but my awe and love for wildlife has never lessened.
____

Point 2
____
I understand some will say, ""But if you love the animals why don't you care that some of them aren't as happy as they would be in the wild.""

I understand this sentiment, but I am torn. I'm torn by my previous reasons for why zoos and aquariums are necessary and my love for the animals themselves.

Is a dolphin in the ocean better than a dolphin in a tank? Yes.
Is a dolphin happier in the ocean than in a tank? Probably. I would bet my life on it, but if that dolphin is in the ocean I can't stand by the edge of the tank and rub his nose. I can't connect with the dolphin in that way that made me fall in love with them.

So, I think that if some dolphins at Seaworld are not as happy as dolphins in the ocean, I'm ok with that. The tank-dolphin's happiness may be what is lain on the altar of conservation.

Zoos and aquariums make us care about the animals. If people don't care about animals then they won't do their best to preserve them.

____
Point 3:
____
Zoos edcuate people. I remember as a child who hated snakes going to the zoo where the exhibit explained why snakes were important to the ecosystem. Before, I thought they were evil creatures. The zoo showed me the truth.

People who understand the role of animals in our world will care more about conservation.


____

Summary: 
____
Zoos and aquariums provide a face to face encounter with the majesty of wildlife. This encounter makes people care about the beautiful creatures they are seeing in person. Caring about the animals leads to conservation efforts. People who see the beauty and importance of these creatures will want to ensure the thriving of their species.

"I'll preface this with saying that I'm a guy and I consider myself extremely feminist and would disagree with the criticisms for feminism for other reasons. I think it's clear that modern feminism is much more than just that belief, and that it's totally reasonable to believe that women and men should be equal, but not be feminist.

There are multiple valid perceptions of equality, some of which do not lend themselves to modern feminism

The perception of equality that most critics of feminism would subscribe to would be a pretty basic ""equality of opportunity,"" where women are given the same legal rights as men. For the most part, this sense of equality is achieved in the developed world, and feminism doesn't seem extremely necessary

The more feminist perception of equality is a more complex view of equality of opportunity that attempts to achieve equality through other actions. For example, many biases prevent women from succeeding in certain fields, so feminists would often embrace some form of affirmative action or grants for women in these fields. I personally believe this is the right way to go about things, but it's it would technically violate the very strict interpretation of equality. Other policies like supporting abortion, maternity leave, etc. all attempt to create equality by making physical factors that advantage men over women less of an issue would fit the same argument as above.

3rd wave feminism is more than just wanting equality

Feminism has evolved from just ""women deserve equal rights"" to a discussion about what it means to be female (or other gender and sometimes racial identities.) This type of discussion is really interesting and really important. However, it can be off-putting to somebody who doesn't really fit the identities feminism focuses on (mainly cisgendered men.) 

I think it's perfectly reasonable for a guy who isn't interested in discussing female identity in modern society to not identity as feminist, or even feel abandoned by it. There are plenty of ways that feminism helps men, but those issues tend to be on the back-burner. Unfortunately, there's not many misogyny-free communities for discussing men's issues. Until more of those exist and are promoted, it doesn't make much sense to expect men to identify as feminist.

"Right now there is almost an unanimous consensus among scholars that Jesus was a real human being. They even go as far as comparing the Christ myth theory to the Moon Landing conspiracy theories and Holocaust deniers. I think their confidence is unwarranted and here's why:

We have ZERO evidence of any Christian activity whatsoever before Paul wrote Galatians around 40-60AD, and no conclusively Christian artifacts have been found dating any earlier than 70 AD. Supposedly Jesus was already attracting huge crowds during his lifetime, and Israel has been studied extensively by archaeologists for a long time. You would think we would find some sort of trinket or writing contemporary to his life, but we've found nothing. Israel was already very literate during Christ's time. Despite what people popularly say, we do have much more evidence for Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great than we do for Christ. That's to be expected of course, but considering how popular the Gospels portray Jesus as being and how much of Israel has been dug up, you'd think we'd have SOMETHING from his lifetime attesting to his existence.

The attestations by Josephus, Tacitus and Suetonius are very dubious. Scholars even admit that part of the Testimonium Flavianum was forged. 

Paul seems to be writing about a heavenly Jesus, not an earthly one at times in his letters.

The Principle of Embarrassment is a very weak argument. We just don't know enough about the context of that era.

The Gospels are written in Greek. Jesus spoke Aramaic. It's possible he also spoke Greek, but you would think the Gospels would have been written in Aramaic originally if they were genuine accounts of Jesus's life.

The Gospels have huge issues. Aside from the fact that they describe magical happenings, they can't even get things like the year he was born right. One gospel suggests that Jesus was born around 5 BC, another suggests 6 AD. Since it's obvious the magical parts didn't happen, is it really that radical to come to the conclusion the whole story is a work of fiction?

I think what happened is there was a preacher in Israel (who was maybe named Yeshua) at the time who claimed to be God and tried to overthrow the Roman client state with his followers and was executed for it. His followers, mostly poor illiterates, started telling tall tales about things he supposedly did while he was alive.

Eventually decades later, some literate Greek believers, most likely in Anatolia wrote made-up biographies of this preacher's life and tacked on moral sayings they attributed to him. Some of these stories became very popular to the extent that people were willing to die for their faith.

In other words, there may have been a person who Jesus was very loosely based on, but the Jesus that Christians worship is essentially a character from political fanfiction. Either that or entirely made up.

Can anyone point me to some evidence that proves Jesus was in fact a real man, who was born under Herod, performed miracles in front of masses of crowds, and went fishing with his buddies in the freshwater Sea of Galilee, only to be killed for it?

I'm not looking at this from a snarky anti-theist view, though I do happen to be an atheist. I just don't think the evidence is compelling or very convincing.

"Just moved to California starting look for an apartment. much to my dismay 9/10 apartments I viewed do not include refrigerators in the lease. I'm from Detroit - where every single apartment I viewed had a fridge included. The first apartment I went to I was like - WHAT? NO FRIDGE????


In California, a refrigerator is not a habitable condition. It's an amenity. 
I found out via r/personalfinance that in Texas  - an air conditioning unit is a habitable condition - meaning the landlord must provide and repair it. In fact, when your A/C unit breaks (and its not tenants' fault), you might not owe rent for days its broken because the unit is only livable while the A/C is working per Texas law.  


There are several reasons state law should change to make a fridge a habitable condition. 

  I believe every other state requires this as a habitable condition, correct me if I'm wrong. In my personal opinion an apartment without a fridge in not habitable, wouldn't you agree? but more importantly.... 

 There's a lot of illegal bait-and-switch going on in the apartment rental market. I'm shopping for an apartment now and I would say about half the listings that say ""fridge included"" are just outright lies. I caught a landlord in this lie just yesterday. He said ""oh well I must have made a mistake online..."" This also happens with dishwashers and with rent prices. You're not fooling any damn body, you listed imaginary apartment with fake pictures, just to get people to show up so you can start throwing sales shit at them.  Sometimes, in areas where the market is really hot (such as West Hollywood), people sign for apartments without having seen the inside first (because the unit is already leased by the time previous tenants move out). Making a fridge an optional amenity gives landlords the ability to LIE and say the unit comes with a fridge and then when they move in, they find out that the fridge belonged to the previous tenants. 
You might say ""well they should read the lease before they sign"" but that logic only holds up in theory. In reality you know there are people getting screwed over on this issue. Such as people from other states who it never occurred to them that a fridge might not be included. 

 California law should mimc Texas law When a habitable condition appliance breaks, the landlord is losing rent money every day it sits broken. In Michigan, when a unit is unlivable, a tenant can break a lease with no penalty and no notice. That gives them very strong incentive to hurry up and fix it already. 
If Texas does this with air conditioners, why cant California do this with a damn refrigerator?

"Often when Hitler or Nazi Germany is brought up on reddit you'll see a comment along the lines of 'Sure Hitler was evil, but you gotta admit he was a good leader' or something along those lines with the idea being that Hitler was a pretty sharp leader who pulled Germany out of a depression and made it great again. I disagree, Hitler was a godawful leader, as good leaders tend not to leave their countries into such total destruction. And the claim that Hitler saved Germany from depression is false, the economic reforms that pulled Germany's bacon out of the economic fire were done by Hjalmar Schacht.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hjalmar_Schacht) Hitler's economic policies set Germany on the course to financial ruin(https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3i78h9/why_do_some_historians_say_nazi_germany_was/cudz604) and forced them into a situation where the only way to survive was to invade and plunder their neighbors. 


So. Hitler ruined the previously successful economic situation, made military alliances with Italy and Japan that did nothing for him except get him in further trouble with an American enemy and an Italian ally constantly needing help, played hell with the warfront by sacking any general who crossed his opinion, and spent valuable resources creating internal strife by persecuting his own people.



So I say Hitler was a good speaker, but a terrible leader.

"I believe that in our current society, heterosexual men are often shamed for expressing their sexuality. Obviously, any specific incident in which a heterosexual male is criticized may or may not be misogynistic based the context of the situation. So this post is mainly inspired by a recent event in the news when a fraternity was suspended for posting banners on their house. You can read about it here 

The basic summary is that a fraternity posted signs with the following messages: 

Rowdy And Fun! Hope your baby girl is ready for a good time

Freshman daughter drop off

Go ahead and drop off mom too

in response, the university president made the following statement equating the posters to condoning sexual assault:

I am outraged about the offensive message directed toward women that was visible for a time on 43rd Street. Our students, campus community and alumni have been offended. While we constantly educate students, faculty and staff about sexual assault and sexual harassment, this incident confirms our collective efforts are still failing to register with some.

It is my view that the banners posted by the fraternity are merely expressing their desire to have sex with women, and never say anything about sexual assault. Equating the two is a fallacy, and is unfair to the men who made the posters. 

Furthermore, the Fraternity president made the following statement equating the posters to demeaning women:

The Fraternity condemns the derogatory and demeaning language used on the banners. Such language has no place in our Fraternity or within any caring community, such as that of ODU

It is my view that no part of these banners were derogatory or demeaning to anyone. They might be vulgar because they carry a sexual implication, but implying a desire to have sex with women is not inherently demeaning to women. Equating vulgar language with demeaning women is also a fallacy.","{'men', 'male'}"
"To say that women and men are equal is simply incorrect. I absolutely do not mean to say that one is better than the other, only that there are fundamental physiological differences between men and women that feminists appear to disregard. Now, in my opinion feminism seeks to advocate that anything that men can do, women can also but only when its convenient. To me it seems like feminists want to have their cake and eat it too. I will give a few examples that I always think about to illustrate my point.

1. The Ray Rice incident. What happened was unfortunate and of course he shouldn't have hit his wife. However, if this was Ray hanging out with another football player and knocked him out, this would not have been a story. Its because he punched a woman that this became a big deal. How can the feminist movement suggest ""Men should NEVER lay their hands on a woman"" but still say that men and women are equal. My answer is that its because men are generally stronger than women, but then that's my point. If you are going to advocate that they are equal then they should receive equal treatment. Again, CMV.

2. Rape cases. In college I have been required to watch numerous sexual harassment videos and attend mandatory training seminars on sexual assault. In these videos they always paint the male as a bad guy and its always targeted towards men. Perhaps I have misunderstood something but if a guy and a girl are both under the influence and they decide to have sex, the girl can then decide the next day that maybe it wasn't a good idea and that the guy should have known better. The guy is then facing rape charges. Why is this on the guy? People use the phrase ""Victim Blaming"" and say that its not on the girl regardless of the fact that she drunk. So what if she had gotten drunk and drove her car into a tree. Can she then say ""Maybe that wasn't a good idea"" and then get off the hook?

3. The draft. This one has also bothered me. According to the United States Selective Service Act, all men between ages 18-25 are required to register for the draft and may be picked for military service if the draft were to be implemented. Why are feminists all over the country not outraged about this? Shouldn't it be men AND women that are required to register for the draft? After all, men and women should be able to perform wartime duties equally right? It just seems like people pick and choose when its convenient for gender equality

Of course there are certain things that should be equal. Wages, education, etc. However I feel that a push for gender equality in every aspect of life is fundamentally wrong. CMV!

"The full quote from Steven Weinberg can be found here(https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Steven_Weinberg).

Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.

I've seen people use this quote many times. To me, it's inflammatory anti-religious nonsense. I'm interested to see the other perspective. Have I misunderstood his quote? Is there something about human nature that I've misunderstood?

First of all, I recognize that religion can cause good people to do bad things. It has done it many times and it will continue to do so. ISIS is the most obvious example right now, but there are countless other examples as well.

What I can't understand is the last sentence:

But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.

He seems to be saying that only religion can cause good people to do bad things. This seems like total nonsense to me. TONS of things can cause good people to do bad things.

For example, soldiers who commit war crimes sometimes do so because they were ""just following orders,"" out of a sense of patriotism, or in order to protect their families.

Poverty can make good people do evil things. 

Drugs can, too. They can temporarily taking away people's sanity, which causes them to do stupid things. Or drug addictions can drive people to such financial desperation that they're willing to do evil things to get their next hit.

---

Let me explain what I understand by ""good people"" and ""evil things."" Perhaps I haven't properly understood what Weinberg meant by these words?

A ""good person"" is someone who wouldn't normally do an evil thing without the influence of some outside force. In the case of this quote, the ""outside force"" is religion.

An ""evil thing"" is anything that society generally sees as extremely bad, such as murder. 

In order to CMV, please:

 convince me that religion is the only thing that can cause good people to do evil things.
 show me that I could've misunderstood Weinberg.
 show me that my definitions of ""good person"" or ""evil thing"" are wrong (in the context of Weinberg's quote, of course).
 anything else that shows that anything I've said is wrong.

My school was great. We went on fun field trips, and even a trip to Europe. Homeschooling your kid is just insurance that he/she will be socially awkward, and disadvantaged. Lots of homeschooling involves religious indoctrination, and very one-sided opinions. In public school you are exposed to many different views, opinions, and types of people.

"In the movie Jurassic World, Hoskins was the head of the park security who wanted to use the raptors for military purposes. He argued that the raptors obeying Owen proved they could be trained to hunt down the enemy, thus saving human lives who would have been risked by having to do it themselves. He later becomes one of the movie's villains (the Indominus was just an animal following it's instincts so it's not a villain even if it's an antagonist) by inviting the military into the park in a coup d'etat to control the situation.  They use the raptors to hunt down the Indominus, with the raptors obeying Owen, until they find it and realize it's part raptor. The raptors then turn on the soldiers, seemingly proving that they are too dangerous to use that way. Then Hoskins is killed by a raptor when trying to get the data on the project, which seems to be an ironic ""he got what he was asking for"". But then Owen manages to get the raptors to follow him again in his fight against the Indominus at the end. 

The movie tries to send a message that was stated in earlier Jurassic Park movies, ""Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should."" The hero doesn't want to use the raptors and they obey him. The military man who wants to use raptors to kill ironically gets killed by raptors.

But the raptors turning on the military was entirely based on the enemy being a giant raptor hybrid. Anywhere else in the world and the idea would have worked out great. The raptors proved how just four of them could decimate a group of highly skilled soldiers even when the soldiers knew what they were fighting against. And even after the raptors had turned on Owen, they showed their loyalty by coming back to him and fighting to the death for him. Which again points to them being very loyal against anything other than a giant alpha raptor. They are great soldiers and the movie shows this repeatedly while vilifying the one wanting them to be soldiers.

edit: As a side note, even the Indominus wasn't a failure. Yes it turned on the people and went on a rampage killing everything that moved. It was smart and fooled everyone to escape it's cage (which I'd question why they didn't have better camera footage and just watch a replay to see what it was doing, why it was able to scratch the walls like that while the security guard was just chilling I have no idea). The movie showed how much of a monster the creature was while pointing at the man who made it with military use in mind and blaming him for making it. But the park staff were the ones who messed that up. They took an intelligent creature and fed it with a crane, never socializing it nor teaching it anything. It was like an abused child who didn't know right from wrong because no one ever taught it. If it had been raised with the care the raptors had it wouldn't have acted like that. And a giant raptor like that that would listen is again a great soldier.

"Unless we convert, of course.

Let me just say that Islam has been through many reforms and most muslims don't wish for the death of anyone.  There is a great deal of integration between Islam and modern society, but this isn't about the moderate majority. Also, terrorism and warfare in the Middle East are heavily fueled by politics.

If we accept that the Koran is the primary source of all that is Islam, and we accept that some (hundreds of millions?) individuals believe that the Koran is the unqestionable word of God, and we accept that the Koran clearly calls for the murder of nonbelievers (In the form of over 100 verses and the violent actions of Muhammad himself), then it follows that we've got a serious problem on our hands that will persist for as long as Islam remains. 

So, what am I missing here? Why are we all tolerating it? Nothing we can do about it? Afraid we'll be murdered for speaking out?

"In Mad Max: Fury Road, the director sets up Immortan Joe to be the ultimate villain devoid of humanity, despite the fact that his actions shown in the movie prove he is not a terrible person but contains the purest and most positive versions of conservative political values. Under the guise of an action movie George Miller has created a propaganda piece to unconsciously convince its audience of his political leanings. 

1. The appearance of the characters tells the audience what to think of them. Joe is covered in tumors and has a Darth Vader mask to look menacing and evil. The actresses who play his wives are all clean, healthy and models in real life.

2. Immortan Joe never hurts any of his wives during the course of the movie, or uses violence to do anything but protect his family and friends. There is also no evidence to suggest he raped them or has physically abused them, as they have no bruises or scars except the grazed bullet wound from Max that they point out.

3. Immortan Joe did not treat his wives as ""objects"" only for the purpose of bearing his children. Max is treated as an object only kept around for his blood and constantly chained up or in a cage. The quick pan of Immortan Joe's palace shows that there was a blackboard, books, a piano, and private quarters for the wives. This shows that he cared enough about them to provide for more than their basic needs to make him sons he wanted them to love him. 

4. Immortan Joe created a society in the middle of a nuclear wasteland. That must have been incredibly difficult, but he gets no praise for that only criticism. The vuvulani had a source of fresh and their own farms and they messed it up, but they don't get any blame. Immortan Joe is accused of having ""Killed the world"" despite having saved it and reestablishing a stable human civilization.   

5. The wives write on the walls the reason they left was that they didn't want their sons to be warlords. But after realizing the green place didn't exist they decide its better to murder hundreds of people to take the citadel for themselves rather than to take 160 days to find a new place to live. In the 2 days that they have been driving they have seen 5 places that can evidently support human life. With the 160 days it is very likely they would find another. Once again they are let off the hook for this bloodthirsty rampage because they are depicted as the protagonists. 

6. Nux becomes a good guy because he gives up his religion and becomes an atheist. That is his entire character. 

7. Immortan Joe and the war boys become very upset about the death of the unborn fetus.

8. Joe gives up significant strategic resources and strains relationships with his allies all in an attempt to get his wives and future child back. In any other movie that would be admirable and make him the hero. 

9. Despite water being a valuable resource needed to trade for guzzoline and for his farms, Immortan Joe gives it away charitably to the vagrants on the outskirts of his society and advises them not to become dependent on he generosity. 

10. In contrast many of the protagonist are only selfishly motivated. Max doesn't care about helping the wives escape, he is only doing what is best for himself. The group doesn't turn around to get the pregnant one who fell off and survived. The Vuvulani don't care about what is best for the people of the citadel they are only trying to put food in their own mouths.  They let Nux kill himself so they can escape, even before the engine was torn out the plan did not look good for him.

"There's this Russian youtuber who's a grandson of a billionaire and he makes videos where he comes up to random people on the street and pays them (usually around 100-300 bucks) to do different things like lick his shoe, take their dress off in public and eat a bunch of ruble notes. He paid this one guy 200 bucks to drink a cup of his pee, which caused quite an uproar in the community.  

I feel like there's a good reason why this is bad, but can't really put my finger on it so my current stance is that it's okay as long as he's not forcing anyone and his actions don't cause any real harm.

"This article(https://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2012/12/health-risk-having-gun-home) does a pretty good job of pulling the relevant statistics together that I find convincing. In searching for critiques of those statistics I found this article that lays out some criticisms of the first article's source study, along with a rebuttal from another journalist who's written on the topic.

I believe that:

1. You, or someone in your family, are more likely to be killed by your gun either purposefully or accidentally than you are to use the gun against an attacker successfully in self-defense.

2. Therefore, if your goal is to make yourself and/or your family safer, then choosing to keep a gun in your home explicitly for that purpose is an irrational decision.


I do believe there is one exception to this. If you have a particular reason or belief that you are likely to be attacked, then, since the odds of being attacked have increased dramatically, then it may be rational to have a gun in the house for self-defense. For example, if you have a stalker. If you have received threats on your life. If you have any reasonable belief that someone will try to harm you specifically. If government or police forces have broken down. Basically, if the odds change so that for you the risk of you or your family being attacked is greater than the risk of having a gun in the house, then it would be rational to have a gun.

But we do know, statistically, on average, that is not the case. So for the average person, the risks are such that the rational decision for maximizing safety is to not keep a gun.

I further believe that if you get other uses out of the gun other than just self-defense, then the other added benefits of having a gun would make it rational to keep one in the house. For example, if somebody was a hunter and or target shooter and they get a lot of joy out of their hobby, that could be worth the risk of gun ownership. Or even if someone cited tradition, or the need of an armed populace as a check on the government, that too could be a perceived benefit to them that makes the safety risk worthwhile. I'm strictly speaking about what's the best decision for maximizing personal and family safety.

Change my view by showing me that the risk of harm to you or your family is lower by having a fire arm in the house.

"Basically, I was looking at some YouTube videos from different places, doing some research on the internet, reading political polls, scientific polls, and reading about history and psychology when I finally reached a conclusion. Because of the way the natural world works, destruction, ignorance, and evil, will always win.

Let me start out by saying, philosophically, I'm a cynic, fatalist (not in the spiritual predetermined sense, but more in the sense that the laws of nature predetermine reality), and an existential nihilist. Basically, nothing really matters, this world and especially mankind are hopeless, and despite our best efforts out struggles are ultimately sadly, but surely, futile. 

Why do I say evil and destruction are predetermined to win? One simple fact, destruction is just so much easier than creation. I have some examples:

1. Look at the Twin Towers, they took decades to build, had hundreds of construction workers, planners, managers, and businessmen that went into building them. Upon completion they housed thousands of workers and was a center for economics. Hundreds of workers, decades, and thousands of lives, all of that torn down because one day a couple hijackers with an airplane decided they wanted to hurt our country. In response our country then killed millions of their people. 

2. Next, nearly three years ago now, young children all went to enjoy just a comfortable day at school, they went to spend time with their friends, learn, and go home and tell their parents all about it. Some teachers watched over them. Love, care, money, billions of years of evolution, all of it ended when one day a deranged man decided the best way to make a point was to go to that school and end the lives of those innocent children and the teachers that watched over them.

3. In our modern world, billions of years of evolution and biodiversity are being destroyed because the human race needs more and more. The planet we inhabit is far behind our singular, greedy goal of accumulating power and wealth. And then, rather than accept the hard truths, most humans would rather listen to the politicians that would happily stick a knife into their back. Billions of years of biodiversity, all destroyed within 500 years of industrialization. 

Honestly, in this world, how could goodness, creation, and knowledge possibly win? How could creation and life win if destruction and death is so much easier? How could knowledge and wisdom win if fear always drags people to ignorance? How could good win when the core of a human is entirely selfish? 

My view is simply this, the world will not change, for it cannot change. It doesn't matter what happens, the victims will either always remain the same or switch out, destruction will always reign supreme, and fear and ignorance will always lead to one man killing another for his resources rather than working together to cultivate them. 

I implore you to change my bleak views, because, honestly, on a dying planet, as a member of a species that has begun to pride itself on ignorance, where things like race and sexual orientation matter more than survival and cooperation, where a group of friends can spend weeks orchestrating a magnificent picnic only for a maniac with a gun to decide their lives don't matter ending it instantly, I don't know what else to think other than that evil has such a massive advantage over good and will always come out on top.","{'his', 'man', 'businessmen'}"
"I believe supporters of the ""Free the Nipple"" (FTN) campaign are miss guided. The movement's aim is to increase gender equality by ignoring our differences and allowing woman to show body parts everyone one in OUR society acknowledges as sexual. I believe that people should have the right not to be exposed, with-in reason, to sexual content in public. The human race is advanced enough to be able to acknowledge and celebrate our differences and create laws that address the real nature of things, as a society I believe we can have true equality and acknowledge we are all different. 







From an ethical point of view the FTN campaign beliefs are too simplistic, they don’t go into the real ethics behind the issue. FTN looks at the issue like this: Men are allowed to show their chest, to be equal women need to be allowed show their chest. But if we allow one group to show sexual parts of their body, which most people don’t want to be exposed to without consent, are we more equal? Or less? Would men be able to show their testicles under FTN’s reasoning? If women can show their sexual parts that people don’t wanna see can men show their sexual parts that people don’t wanna see.









We should accept our differences and create deeper laws that fit all, with true equality. Right now I think the laws we have are fair, there’s no “women can’t show their breasts statute” there are public decency laws. I think public decency laws are extremely fair they generally aren’t specific, they let the society choose what is indecent and what isn’t, I think the greater society should choose. If breasts weren’t sexualised as much as they are in our society the laws we have now wouldn’t prosecute free nipples. 







Although in most instances I believe the ""We shouldn't focus on this issue because there are bigger issues"" argument is wrong…  we really should be tackling real gender inequality where there are actual principles being violated like the pay gap and female under representation in government. 






 Let’s take the golden approach – try find absurdities,






You wouldn’t want a man or woman to flash their respective vagina/ penis a you or your kids, I think shown breasts are as sexually thought of as a vagina. If a man flashes his penis at someone it’s quite fairly considered sexual assault. 
If we take the simplistic approach that the FTP movement does, men and women should be treated exactly the same, woman wear G strings on the beach, then men can wear G Strings on the beach, if men wore G strings their testicles would show, try telling the mothers that their kids have to exposed to deez nuts to have an equal society – bullshit.

"Nothing unusual here. I believe people have the right to defend themselves to the best of their ability, instead of relying on the Powers That Be to protect them. I also think it is a useful check on the ultimate power of the State.

To elaborate, when you are under attack, the single best tool you can have is a gun. It immediately redefines the situation and makes death a very real possibility for your assailant. If a mugger comes for an unarmed man, the risk is the guy yelling or maybe trying to punch you vs. the reward of his smartphone and whatever's in his wallet. Not bad. If he has a gun, it tips the scale way, way over to the risk side. A gun doesn't even have to be fired to defuse a situation. Without one, you are reduced to giving the guy every valuable thing you have and hoping he's feeling nice at the end of it. In other situations, calling the cops. After all, when seconds count, the Police are only minutes away. I don't think the government can reasonably expect their citizens to place that much trust in them.
Also, guns are a tremendous equalizer. Barring unusual circumstances, a women is very unlikely to win a physical confrontation with a man. If she has a gun, and her attacker does not, she has a tremendous advantage. If the attacker does as well, they are evenly matched at worst. Significantly better odds than giving away all your stuff and placing your faith in human decency. This is also true for the elderly and any man of below average fighting prowess. Put simply, guns empower the weak and put them on even terms with the strong.

I think guns are also a useful check on the government's power. To be clear, I am not some crazy redneck living in the mountains planning on toppling the government. It is simply an indisputable fact that mass ownership of guns is power to the people. Now, you may argue that ""the people"" are stupid and can't be trusted with that power. A valid perspective I suppose, though not one very compatible with democracy. If the citizens are armed, the state is much more limited in what they can do. There's a big difference between people throwing bricks at jack-booted thugs and shooting bullets. In countries with strict gun control, the government can push their people much farther before facing serious retribution. It tips the power balance strongly in favor of the government. Nobody is happy with the US government, but they could never descend to the level of actual tyranny before we overthrew them.

Also, an armed citizenry makes your country much more formidable in a war. The US obviously doesn't have to worry about that, but there's a reason no one ever messes with the Swiss. Fighting the entire population of a country instead of just the army is a daunting proposition, and a significant deterrent to would-be invaders. Not everyone has to be worried about this, but it is a factor.

Finally, anyone who responds saying ""Lol, what's a rifle going to do against an M1 Abrams?"" really needs to google the words ""guerrilla"" or ""Afghanistan"". Or perhaps ""tactical literacy"".

"First, what I refer to as ""hunting"" is the killing or trapping of any animal, with the purpose of doing so, as sport, whether it be to eat them as food or keep them as trophies. I am not talking about the regulated hunting of threatening species or the killing of animals in situations where they pose significant danger.

Recently, we've seen the story of Cecil the lion become big news across the country and in the world at large. The fact that we as humans hold dominion over all other earthly creatures necessitates the notion of a responsibility we have in keeping balance and order to the food chain, considering that humans are the top of it. 

Killing for sport is something--one could argue--not inherent only in humans, but we've taken it beyond what it means if an animal were to kill another animal for sport just by sheer organization. I'm speaking of our current gaming rules and regulations in place, meant to keep this balance--one would want to believe--but a system well beyond anything an animal killing another animal for sport could come up with, for obvious reasons. And, as the story of Cecil the lion illustrates, the system governing wildlife from being hunted and killed is flawed, to say the least.

In regards to the act of hunting, and then using prey as food, I would argue that in our modern society, this is completely unnecesary, given the obvious institutions in place all ready, i.e., the supermarket. 

The bottom line may be that hunting exists because we as humans enjoy it, it is thrilling to us, but should that condone its existence? We condemn the murder of humans. Why view other animals any different in that regard?

Admittedly, the quandary I have with my argument is that I feel it should be banned all over the world. However, due to the problems and beliefs of other societies around the world, some of which being so underdeveloped that hunting game is a valuable source of income, I have to limit my banning to the United States alone. By doing this, I'm brought back to the senseless killing of Cecil the lion, which was done in a different country. I argue, though, that it was carried out by an American, one who believed in the sport of hunting, who willingly paid tens of thousands of dollars to do it, and that, had he come from a society that looked down on the sport, he might not have had such determination to carry out what he did.

Lastly, I say it is antiquated, but that is a reflection of my opinion based on the notion that hunting was a means of surviving which is no longer necessary in our current society. This definition recognizes that at one point, there was a reason at some point in history for its existence, however.

What i see is that while for men sex is a need, like hunger and all (a need that doesn't kill us but instead makes us suffer if unsatisfied), for women it's more of a take-it-or-leave-it thing, something they can enjoy but that they don't really need, a nice thing to have but that doesn't really matter much if they don't have it, like, say, chocolate (although women would be far less willing to give up chocolate in my experience).

"Thought I would flip the usual ""Modern art isn't real art"" stance around and present a muscular defense of the various 'radical' branches of 20th and 21st century art. Come at me with all you've got about the poverty of modern art! I'm going to start with a rebuttal of some of the common points raised against the worth of modern art, and then list some of the artists I like and why I like them.


So here's what I see as the commonly raised objections to the value of modern and contemporary art (the distinction between these two terms is somewhat ambiguous, but basically modern art is most of what was created from 1900-1960s, and then a shift to 'contemporary' art gradually occurred). 


 No effort/technical skill is required to create it

 ""I don't get it/it's just colors""

 It's not pretty/beautiful

Please let me know of any others you can think of! But, to address these I've listed:


First: No effort is required to create it. Yes, in many cases very little traditional technical skill is necessary to create any number of famous pieces of the last century. And by the same token, often very little quantifiable time or physical effort would have been necessary to create the same pieces. But why do we want art to require technical skill or effort? The answer seems to me that it makes worth quantifiable in terms of man-hours spent or technical skills applied - we assign worth to goods with money, and we earn certain amounts of money based on the time we work at a particular job. That feels simple - but actually we know when we think about it that even the apparently firm valuation possible with money is linked to arbitrary process - the economic status of the country which issues it, political contingencies and emergencies, the variability of market prices for goods and services, etc. And time itself is subject to the same instability - it zips by when we're having fun, and drags endlessly when we're working on a tedious task. Similar insights to these are driving factors in the way the artwork of the 20th century moved gradually away from traditional technical representation of subject matter. When we acknowledge that all processes of valuation are, at bottom, arbitrary, we are liberated from the requirement to adhere to traditional systems of valuation, but also forced to confront the problem of using any system of valuation at all. If all value is arbitrary, can we value anything? Is creation valuable? Life itself?


This brings us the 2nd objection: ""It's just colors/abstract"". A common whipping-boy for Reddit's typical reaction against modern art is Mark Rothko, whose monumental color blocks are often presented as a sort of ""Emperor's New Clothes"". And of course, while there actually is a great deal of technical canvas and paint ability which goes into Rothko's works, traditional figurative techniques are abandoned in them. But we must take note: the 'effort' Rothko is putting into his work is not technical effort but rather effort towards discovering a system of valuation which he can stand on and for after he has abandoned traditional systems. For Rothko, his paintings represented man's transcendental relationship with his own consciousness, a kind of pure, experiential expression of pure Being. It is noteworthy that the dominant philosophical trends of the time were phenomenology and existentialism, which were attempts to find a fundamental ground for consciousness in a newly modern world whose science had demoted God from his throne but neglected to nominate a new Fundamental Arbiter in replacement. So, while Rothko does not use traditional figurative techniques, his work is effortful in the sense that it tries to express a new sense of modern spirituality without God. Variations of the same can be said for much of the various avant-gardes of the first half of the 20th century; traditional artistic valuation was being abandoned (and concrete and universal measurement along with it), but the search for a new ground from and of which to create art was a consuming occupation.


And finally, number 3, ""It's not beautiful/it's ugly"": This point obviously is answered to some degree by the points I've previously made - in dismissing traditional techniques, traditional standards are also held up to question. Beauty becomes something that is not necessarily inherent in a particular nude figure painted with particular colors and brush-strokes, if it is even something to be strived after at all. Duchamp's 'Fountain', among much of his other work, was a fairly direct critique of traditional concepts of artistic beauty, and later Conceptual artists would work with ideas which were in many cases almost totally devoid of physical manifestation, or any object with which to invest with traditional beauty. That doesn't mean many of their works are not beautiful however - the simplicity and poetic elegance of Hans Haacke's Condensation Cube would, I argue, meet many updated standards of beauty; a simple transparent figure which manifests changes in the heat and pressure of the room it is within it, providing a sort of spiritual residue of the minds and bodies which perceive and surround it. In any case, the gist of my rebuttal to this last point is that just as artistic techniques had to shift fundamentally to address our experience of living in the modern age, so did standards of beauty, and even the valuation of beauty itself.


So those are my initial defenses against some of the more common critiques of modern art - please do your best to pick them apart, as well as point out other points that I've missed. Take your best shot! But now that I've put up a defense, I'm going to launch a little offense - examples of some of my favorite artists of the last century, all having worked at some points at least in very untraditional mediums. Perhaps some of you will appreciate these artists as much as I do - and perhaps others of you will gain new fodder for the pointed attacks against my favorable stance towards modern art that I am hoping for!


I love Marcel Duchamp (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Duchamp_Fountaine.jpg). I love Dieter Roth which, as portions constantly blink on and off, modulate to new ambiguities the ambiguity already present in each phrase, demonstrate a freedom of creation bound to the realm of play opened by the identification of the artist with his social role.


OK, so that's enough theorizing from me - change my view! Make me realize that modern art is worthless. I don't care how you do it, but I want to be feeling deep existential dread at the way I've wasted years of my life on a total void by the time I wake up tomorrow morning! Have at it.

"This post is about Europe because that is the only context I am familiar enough to argue about. Feel free to bring up other contexts, though. 

I believe Europe should only take in female refugees due to three reasons. Women and girls are harmed far worse in the conflicts and in the refugee camps than men and boys are. The receiving countries suffer from the violence and criminality of those refugees who fail to integrate, and lastly having clear lines on who can enter and can not does not create false hope and unnecessary deaths. At the moment refugees are over 70% male, which in practice means we mostly ignore the most vulnerable population.

Women are the primary victims of these conflicts:
In many societies, women and girls face specific risks and are less likely than men and boys to have access to their rights, due to their gender roles and position in society. In situations of displacement, these risks – particularly discrimination and sexual and gender-based violence – can be exacerbated.

Crime. Higher criminality of men is well known.

As is that of immigrants and refugees from poor countries.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_crime

Recently Sweden Democrats, an anti-immigrant party polled as the largest party in Sweden, after an asylum seeker murdered two people in Ikea for no apparent reason. The debate about refugee criminality seems to be leading many to rather extreme positions. Since women commit next to no sex and violent crime, especially in patriarchal cultures, this would relieve some of the fears of the native populations.

The last argument is admittedly weak. People are very bad at probabilities. Therefore it might be best not to take in men at all, as that would create false hope and cause many of them to risk their lives and property in hopes of an asylum. From a cost perspective, it would be easier and faster to automatically deport all men. Some family exceptions would of course be appropriate.

"The US military is currently about 15% female. The draft should keep in line with the amount of women currently in service. An influx of 50-50 genders would cause logistics issues on ships, in barracks, and in the culture. 

Note that the US military is beginning the formal inclusion of women in most combat roles. Some will likely remain closed, and others like artillery and machinegunning will require physical standards that will deter most women.

The Anti-War Argument: People won't want their daughters dying overseas. Knowing that a draft will include all young Americans will make our beautiful nation less quick to jump into foreign quagmires.

The Equality Argument: Women are included in the burden, playing a role proportionate to the military's current demographics. Women have proved capable in a variety of combat and leadership roles in militaries around the world, and the SJW generation could offer up a few fierce warriors (especially since a lot of fighting these days is done on a keyboard).

"So, it's obvious to anyone who took a math class that the average number of sex partners between straight men and straight women must be the same. 

However, the median can be different.

According to the CDC, the median number of opposite-sex partners in a lifetime is 6.6 for men, and 4.3 for women. Basic mathematics concludes this: Take two sets of numbers (set M and set F). M and F have the same mean, but F has a smaller median than M. Therefore, the numbers in M are more balanced across the board than the numbers in F.

I feel like there is a backlash against immigration for multiple reasons, like racism, not immigrating well, and crimes. 

I feel that people might be more welcoming to asylumseekers if they are known to not be criminals, and that that causes both racism and not immigrating well to lessen.

On the other hand if you come to another country because you fear for your life, and know that you will be kicked out if you commit a crime then being a criminal is apparently so important to you, that the country would be completely justified in kicking you out.

"Hello. I think a vast majority of our security problems on our networks and computational devices stems from technical illiteracy from the everyday user. 

Also, the functionality of a computer nowadays is being restricted heavily by catering computers to the lowest common denominator of computer users, ie ""I just borrowed my grandsons computer to send a virtual e-mail to Susan"".

Points:

-Computers have become easier to use, but generally do this by removing choice, not by improving usability. Most people these days do not know how to do simple tasks on computers. How do you instruct a computer to copy all files that start with July and end with .jpg from a folder and all it's subfolders to a separate folder titled ""Camping Photos""? 

-The population of Americans who are brand new to computing is shrinking every day, and will continue shrinking due to death. As such, it is illogical to have them be the standard to which software is designed. 

-People who have had computers available their entire lives are incapable of troubleshooting the machines that they've grown up with from a small age, as their interactions with the machine have been simplistic and uninteresting. How many times have you seen someone ""link"" to a photo or a document by saying; ""Here, click this: C:\Users\JCena\Files\pr0n.gif""

-Modern computers have many abstraction layers that separate a user from the actual actions being taken. People develop metaphors for interactions with machines, and some of these become standards. For instance, I won't sit here and tell you that the ""Files and folders"" metaphor  for organizing information on machines wasn't successful. Microsoft is especially guilty of this. What is a ""briefcase""? When I say ""Library"", are you thinking of ""That folder that isn't a folder that contains shortcuts to all my shit"", or are you thinking ""A file full of programming functions that allows a programmer to utilize features without having to write it all themselves""?

-By hiding machine functionality, the quality of that functionality degrades (or at least, doesn't improve). 

-The ""user friendliness"" leads to a paradigm where users are not expected nor required to in any way expend any effort in learning how to use a machine that they will be using a lot. This means users are dumber, and more likely to break things.

"growing up in america i was condition to believe women's breast are sexual organs do to the fact that we over sexualized them too much. it wasnt till recently that i came to conscious and started realizing that there is practically no way a woman's breast could be sexual organs. i mean obviously we men have breast too and our breast dont stimulate the opposite sex in any different way. and yes i'm well aware that during sex women could receive lots of stimulation through them in the act of foreplay. but so do other body parts, like the neck, the mouth, the foot, etc. lets also not forget that women do need their breast to breastfeed  their children, which this obviously screams out that they cant be sex organs.

anyways it seems like the more i try to believe this the more negative reactions i get from those around me. people here still insist that women's breast are sexual organs and the fact that women here in america, unlike women in africa or other countries in europe are still too afraid to go topless outside when its too hot kinda punctuates this believe. we also must forget that or government does believe they are sexual breast as it is against the law either way for women to go topless out in the streets. so i was wondering if this is correct that maybe you guys can then convince me that they are sexual organs. 

I also like to point out that i was watching that documentary Free The Nipple the other day on Netflix and it really touched me. i think it really is unfair that during heatwave days a man can take his shirt off in public yet women can't. i think we americans are too damn dramatic going judgmentally ballistic when we see boobs in public. at the same do to how we americans have been sexually conditioned since day one i'm actually amazed that there are women here who complain about not being able to go topless out in public. i thought that would of been the worst and most humiliating nightmare for an American woman.

Ashley Madison was a website for cheaters. And generally cheating is wrong, but it isn't always wrong. Maybe it's an open, non-monogamous relationship. Maybe the guy was cheating with the blessing of his wife. Maybe the wife was completely shut down sexually and the choice was between having an affair on the side to fulfill his sexual needs or throw away an otherwise happy marriage. Maybe we as society shouldn't be in the position to judge other people's personal lives just because we disagree with someone else's action. Just because you don't want to be cheated on it doesn't mean that you can judge cheaters who were in some situation that you know nothing about and are in no position to pass judgement on.

There was a vox(?) article about the lives of people who twitter has shamed after their shaming. I worry that the response to this leak is going to be out of proportion to the general social backlash that a cheater receives. Normally when someone cheats (without the consent of their SO) their relationship ends and that is more or less the extent of it. The nature of this leak is such that it will expose thousands of people to blackmail and professional consequences all for something that while, morally unacceptable in our society, is not criminal.  

Also look at the fucking hypocrisy. Reddit collectively denounced Gawker for publishing the allegations that some businessman was visiting a male prostitute like a month ago. Now all of a sudden it is fine to go outing all these other men who were cheating or attempting to cheat on their spouses? It's the exact same situation that the businessman in the Gawker article was in, but because it is 1 million people instead of just one specific person we don't feel sympathy? That's bullshit.

TL;DR Keep your nose out of other people's business you judgmental asshole.

"Title is self explanatory, but I'll elaborate. 

Mental illnesses are seen as a deviation of ""normal"" human thought or behavior.  Behavior that we as animals find unnerving, dangerous, or anxiety inducing because of our biology are seen as mentally Ill behaviors, or thoughts. 

An individual being born with a given gender, and appearing to be that gender, and functioning perfectly as that gender (biologically), but having a disconnect with how his mind feels about his body shows that his mind is sick. 

The only reason were catering to these people instead of giving them the psychological care they deserve is because we have the means to. We can (to a certain extent) change your gender. So well make it a social issue as to not leave these people out, because now we don't have to. 

But let's take a different route. 

Let's say I genuinely believed I was a mermaid (Merman? Merhombre?). You'd think I'm a loon, my behavior and my belief goes against social norms, I would be labeled as mentally ill.  But if the technological means came available to give me gills, and a tail then a social movement would gather around mermaidism, and people would expect to be taken seriously. 

Or so goes my thinking. 

I've fielded the other side and spoken to some transgender individuals, and I still don't buy the argument that it's not a mental illness.

"I am a 100% straight male, as in, I'm ONLY into straight women; lesbians gross me out, though I don't care who's into who or who wants to marry each other; people should be free to do as they wish. Basically, I have a hard enough time as it is with straight women and a ""bisexual"" girl is triple the drama, with no added benefits. I've never been into 'bisexual' women and if I'm attracted to one or she's attracted to me and I find out she's into women or has sex with them, it's pretty much a deal-breaker from then on. I then just feel betrayed afterwards, thinking I was a fool for going after a girl who wants a girl (instead of me). 

My biggest concerns if I dated a 'bisexual' girl are:

 A. Any girl who claims to be 'bisexual' would want a woman way more than she would ever a guy. She literally has double the options to potentially cheat or leave me for someone else, and cheating/being dumped is even a problem in straight couple relationships. (I'm a guy and even I don't know why women would want us over other women and their soft, supple bodies just made for giving and receiving pleasure.)

 B. Constantly having to compete with women for her attention. (I can't compete with boobs!)

 C. A 'bisexual' girl's very likely (in my view) not going to be monogamous, and I'm not into three-ways, lesbians, or an ""open relationship.""

 D. A 'bisexual' girl's very likely to not want a relationship; just casual sex and ""fooling around."" (Men on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and women on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and the weekend, I'd assume.)

And I'm sexually inexperienced, so unlike the 'sexually advanced,' I don't have this whole ""rainbow of sexuality Kinsey scale"" level of experience behind me. If I had orgies and stuff, and banged every type of human being alive and had notches in the triple digits by now (at age 28), maybe I'd be more understanding of it all. But I'm pretty vanilla and virginal, at this point. So I don't get the whole ""Kinsey sex scale"" stuff beyond ""Straight"" and ""everything else (LGBT, etc).""

To be honest, I barely even accept ""bisexual"" as a real thing. (It was never spoken of in society until around 10-15 years ago; now every other woman claims to be ""bi"" and says how much she loves going down on women.) But since science backs it up, I have to back it up as being real, as well. No matter how much I can't comprehend simultaneously being into both men and women at the same time, equally. I literally cannot even comprehend that; it's so far from what I'd personally want, sexually speaking.

However, with all this said, I am also a big hopeless romantic. My ideal girl, physical traits aside, would be kind, sweet, gentle, caring, loving, open-minded, an easy-listener and a best friend. Mainly, I want a girl just to be into ME and no one else. And the argument from the other side I've heard before are that 'bisexuals' (and pansexuals) tend to be more loving, compassionate, kind, and open-minded, as they judge less on the person's outer exterior and more on their inner personality. 

And the reason I am so sexually inexperienced is me are less shallow and more into who a person truly are,"" then they would be a more suitable choice for me to go after, assuming this is true.

So, I think that covers it all. I'm open to changing my mind on it, if people are intelligent and open-minded enough to convince me why I could potentially be wrong about my stance on 'bisexuals.'","{'men', 'guy', 'fool'}"
"The 2016 US presidential primary race is well underway, and the large pool of candidates in both major political parties is exposing a significant gap in the nominating process. Some of the leading candidates are of questionable party affiliation (e.g. Donald  Trump is now a registered Republican but has faced criticism for switching parties throughout his lifetime; Lincoln Chafee was a Republican while serving as a Mayor, Senator, and Governor, and only became a Democrat in 2013) or are unabashedly independent of any party affiliation (Bernie Sanders is not a registered Democrat but still running for the Democratic nomination).  

This has led to a lot of controversy on both sides about throwing the weight of the party behind someone whose allegiance to the party is questionable, and with good reason. For the following reasons, I believe that by law only registered members of a political party should be able to seek and obtain that party's nomination for elected office. 

1) Parties spend a substantial amount of resources to try to elect their nominees. These resources often come from contributions (in terms of money, activism, work hours etc) governed by election law made by party members or supporters to support fellow party members. It is inappropriate to allocate these resources to someone who, despite achieving the nomination, is not even a member of the party in the first place.

2) Many third parties with access to general election ballots often nominate the same person, which causes that individual to appear on the ballot several times for the same position. This duplication is unfair to candidates from other parties (especially third parties) who may only appear on the ballot once. For the purposes of the official ballot, parties should only be allowed to formally nominate their own members, or no one at all. 

3) The members of a political party's presidential ticket are the de facto leaders of their national party during and (if elected) after the election. The same principle applies for nominees for Governor at the state-level, Mayor at the municipality-level, etc. Nominees' political positions are often absorbed into the general party platform, which can impact elections and party voter turnout elsewhere. It is nonsensical, and unfair to party members, for their de facto leaders to be from another party or no party at all, especially given that nominations are mostly a function of popular vote. (Tangentially, I am also opposed to ""open primaries"" where voters who aren't registered members of a political party can still vote in that party's primary election, but I suppose that's a topic for another CMV post. And of course, it should continue to be against election rules to be a registered member of more than one political party.)

4) There is nothing wrong with or prohibitive about running for office as an independent. Ross Perot staged a pretty successful third party run for president in 1992. Sanders is the longest serving independent in the Senate. Many other people have been elected to political office at various levels of government without obtaining a major party nomination. Our political system does not preclude independents from winning elections, so any argument that an independent's only real chance of winning is to seek the nomination of a party with which (s)he does not formally affiliate is historically and demonstrably invalid. 

CMV.

Edit: I understand a lot of people on reddit are Bernie Sanders supporters, and that my view might argue against his candidacy in the Democratic primary. For the record, I am not a Clinton or a Trump supporter; nor am I decidedly against Sanders as a candidate if he makes to the general election. I hope my replies are not being downvoted (against this sub's rules) because I am not 100% in favor of Sanders.

However I've spoken with some interesting characters who are convinced there is evidence to believe that there are quite large differences between so called human 'races' and they therefore think this is a justification for lets say 'proto-racism'.

"The primary focus of the military should be only to increase the efficiency of its operations. The military does not owe any group anything, and it has no obligation to accommodate women. Having women in the military will only cause problems. At best you will get a couple more people- the few women who can pass the physical standards. For that you take the risk of the women not able to endure properly and be able to carry heavy equipment, and the possibility of the women being a distraction to the men (or vice versa), among other unforeseen problems.


The arguments for women in military combat roles seem to center around appeals to discrimination, and this is not going to convince me. I do not see any way I could be convinced that men and women are 'the same' and 'not being treated fairly'. The purpose of the military is to conduct its operations the best it can, it does not owe anything to women or to treat people fairly.


The other main argument from the other side is to call people with my point of view terrible people and try to shame us. This also will not be effective. I have nothing at all against women. In fact part of the reason I hold this view is because I like women so much. I do not think they should have to endure the horrors of military combat like men do. Men are more expendable than women are. Being responsible for reproduction, I think a woman's life actually has a bit more worth than a mans, and therefore we should keep them out of harm's way.


In all, I don't see any reason why women should have combat roles in the military.",{'men'}
"I think that bodily autonomy is important, however - I also believe that equal rights are important. The way our society is currently structured, a woman has 100% control over what happens to a baby, regardless of circumstances regarding conception. She can choose to carry it to term or she can choose to abort it. The male has few rights and none of them concrete in most countries - in the past, virtually every lawsuit to initiate or prevent an abortion has failed.

I think this is good. I think a woman should have full rights to control her body, and the pregnancy is definitely a matter of bodily autonomy. The child that ensues as a result, however, is not. I think, regardless of circumstances of conception, the biological mother/father should be able to opt out of parental rights and responsibilities. At birth, the baby will be delivered/retained by the person who did not sign the waiver, and raised by them - and them alone. Any visitation rights/contact/influence will be at the discretion of the now sole legal guardian.

This way, mothers who don't want the child but may be opposed to an abortion (for whatever reason) can surrender the child to the father without worrying about any legal ramifications. Similarly, any male who doesn't want to participate in the raising of the child should be able to sign a form and waive all legal rights and responsibilities including child support.

This is based on the logic that most pregnancies that are unwanted are either ""accidents"" (I.E. Nobody's fault, condom broke, hormonal B.C. failed, they were stupid and didn't even pull out, etc...) or intentional (Poked holes in the condom, raped, lied about B.C.). I don't believe there are many pregnancies where one party was solely at fault, though I may be wrong on this. As a result, if they choose not to be a part of/don't want that child, I think they should be absolved of pregnancy/birth/child rearing fees.

I don't think either party having to take responsibility for something they didn't want/didn't intend to happen is right. I think that our current system is pretty fucked, honestly, especially because of incidents like these. While rare, and definitely not the norm, the idea that anyone can pay so heavily for something they didn't legally consent to is pretty shocking.

Note: This should only apply to jurisdictions where abortion is legal. Any place where it isn't, both parties are conceivably being forced to bear the pregnancy, and any costs associated with bearing it should be split. That's only if it's going up for adoption, of course.

TL;DR - You shouldn't have to pay for a baby if you didn't want the baby and just got unlucky/were stupid.

"NFL retiree James Harrison is facing controversy after he stripped his children of participation trophies, i.e. ""trophies for nothing"". The result has been a bitter debate on Twitter under the hashtag #TrophiesForEveryone. The big problem is that this is a false dichotomy:

1) Awarding trophies for participation =/= not awarding extra special trophies for winning. Victory and accomplishment deserve to be celebrated, but so does being part of a team and of a larger whole.

2) Adult society awards both victory and participation. When did you last get one of these(https://thestruggleembraced.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/i-voted-sticker.jpg)? This is essentially a participation trophy; as long as you are an adult US citizen without (depending on the state) a felony record, you can get one of these every year just for showing up. But does that make them any more hollow? Do we only congratulate people who vote for the winning candidate? In fact, ""participatory"" is a huge buzzword in everything from design to governance, reflecting that we in the West do not aspire to a winner-take-all, might-makes-right society, but instead encourage the broadest range of participation, even if it means that the losers get to have their voice heard.

3) A participation trophy is not necessarily the PC SJW ""Everyone's a Winner :)"" thing that it is sometimes made out to be. Instead, it reflects that participation is a chosen value, indeed the chosen value of democratic society.

"This is how it appears to me as a non-American. In effect, people are moving to support these two candidates mostly in response to the same set of events:

- Disillusionment with the political establishment. Voters are fed up with the highly polished and spin doctored politicians, with overtly similar views, that make up the rest of the leadership candidates. Moreover they feel the insularity of groups within political circles leads to a strong divergence from doing what is best for the people to doing what is best for the elite. In response they support people with seemingly strongly felt policy proposals, messages, and who have only - if at all, existed at the forefront of mainstream politics.

- A response to the emergence of political dynasties. Hillary and Jeb both feel like rehashes of past presidents, and voters fear an arrogance and weakening of democracy if familial dominance is extended.

- Anger at cronyism and corruption. Support for people percieved to fall less into donor's pockets. Sanders stands against this kind of ""selling out"" and Trump would seem to be rich enough to fund himself. (Reality isn't important here, only what people think).

- Upset at being left behind financially. Sanders talks about raising the minimum wage, organising co-ops and unions and making trade deals beneficial to the American people. Trump talks about forcing companies to situate factories in the USA, especially in cities on steep decline like Detroit. Voter feel these two

- Upset at the pace of change. (This goes in alternate directions so may be less suitable). The USA is deeply split in its range of ideologies, Obama felt it prudent to oppose Gay marriage officially when he first ran for President due to this in order to gain enough votes. With Trump, to quite Iain Dey in the London Times ""Large numbers of Americans are struggling to get their opinions up to speed with the liberal agenda and they are fed up with being ignored...which is why a candidate currently percieved to be a joke is leading the race for the Republican presidential nomination"" . Conversely others feel that Sanders would push their nation towards a more tolerant and open nation, and more supportive of minorities and the less well off.

"The subject of Podium girls is quite controversial on cycling subs, good enough to generate all-time top and controversial threads and I would like to know what people think about it.

My position is simple: When the issue is brought to discussion I always end up concluding that the problem is the lack of TV coverage of women's cycling and not the concept of podium girls.

Obviously there are some podium girls moments that belong on r/cringe like this one, but these are extreme examples which do not represent the majority. 

I really like to watch women's cycling and would really be pleased to see more of it on TV (there's like 3 or 4 days of racing a year on Eurosport right now) and the fact that women on the sport are more visible on the podium than on the bike is the problem, IMO. I've seen examples on twitter of happy parents talking about little girls thinking ""ooh I can do that too?"" when La Course was on TV on the last day of Tour de France. And that is an example that there's a lack of coverage (but that's not the issue I want you to discuss).

Then there's the semantics, ""podium girls"" sound quite worse than ""podium women"" which would sound much more reasonable, and I agree with that, let's change the name of it. There's a very recent example of ""podium men"" on a Norwegian race, which sounds a fair way to balance the absence of men on the podiums of women's cycling and apparently would be a reason for people to say we're in a fair position. 

Yet, people think the idea of podium men/women is disgusting and distasteful.
And that's the part I really don't understand and the reason I came to CMV - maybe because I see podium women since I was a kid? 
There's the argument of objectifying people, but they are models which are pleased to do their job.
Also it's a thing that takes seconds, kisses are a way of congratulate people and how many times have we joked about it and created similar photos with our friends, while having a good time?

Some argue that there's embarrassment between podium girls and the riders, and that may be true, but they're not displeased. Slightly out of context - this video was spread on the web(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V70R9hYECW0) and people think it's cute while being a much more embarrassing thing at the start.
I've seen riders a little more embarrassed when they had to greet politicians.

The argument against podium women that I agree with is the fact that most of them don't know about cycling. On a recent event on my country, only 2 out of 8 or 10 (I can't recall) had good knowledge about the sport according to a TV report which only had the intent of talking a bit about those girls. Young riders or kids could be there on the podium congratulating the riders and meeting their heroes. Yet, we should consider that podium girls usually represent brands, and they're a way of sponsoring a race and that would need to be rethought if we replaced them.

Note that I'm talking about cycling, on other sports you can see examples that could be easily labeled as sexism, which do not apply to the regular cycling podium, even though I welcome your arguments if you talk about other sports.

And well, if you disagree with me, just don't do this, I want to know why you think I'm wrong and I want you to change my view

"It is my belief that self driving cars and cars that pollute lesser than their gas powered counterparts are an unnecessary diversion in creating a safe cleaner people transportation system. We already have it! It’s the trains! If public transport such as railways are expanded and given priority over road vehicles in infrastructure, then we can achieve the goals that the automotive industry is trying to achieve very quickly.

We should divert the resources that we spend on making smarter cars (finances and human capital) to making smarter, faster, safer, public transport and expand the rail network. If we just expand the rail network then people will automatically shift from driving a car to riding on a train as their preferred choice of daily commute.

Some of the points I have against road transport for individuals.


•	Environmental impact- A vast majority of cars are running on fuels that emit pollutants in the environment.


•	Safety- Road injury was one of the top 10 causes of death in the world. According to WHO, road injury took lives of 1.3 Million people in the last decade.


•	Stress– While driving for enjoyment is really fun on your off days, daily commute hardly is. We are spending a nice chunk of our day that we can spend relaxing, reading or working to complete the last minute project on a rather stressful, and repetitive driving route facing traffic jams and asshole drivers.


•	Energy efficiency – A car owner takes a Ton of metal with him just to get from point A to B. Fuel efficiency of trains is superior to that of cars.


•	Maintenance – a car requires frequent upkeep and maintenance of its parts and components.


•	Economy – Transportation is lot more expensive in cars.
Here are some points that I have for expansion of public transport.


•	Bonus free time – When I’m in a train I can browse my phone, read a news paper work on my presentation without the fear of killing someone. This is something driverless cars are trying to achieve and are still years away from it.


•	Potty Breaks – trains can be modified to have them, cars don’t. I’d have to pause my driving, find a gas station and then resume it again, why do that when you can go on the go.


•	Fuel Efficiency.


•	Noise reduction.


•	Skill Transfer- People who graduate in engineering and were thinking of joining an automotive manufacturer can just as easily join a locomotive manufacturer.


I am not arguing for an absolute ban on using cars, I just think if we focus on public transport more than we would solve a lot of problems that automotive market is trying to eliminate. Problems such as energy efficiency, pollution, and vehicle automation can be achieved with technology that we have today.

"This is the Ken Ham from the Bill Nye vs Ken Ham debate.

By the way, I'm agnostic, and believe in evolution and such.

I do not believe that he is right, but I think that the arguments he makes are well thought out and properly reasoned, assuming the the axiom that ""God is good, God is great, and the Bible is the word of God"".

I am not above believing science at its core is a set of axioms - its main axiom is something along the lines of one cannot dispute that which is observed. It's not fundamentally different from God is good, God is great, and the Bible is the word of God. I just happen to come to believe that the former set of axioms is better, and disagree with the latter set of axioms.

In the debate Ken Ham talks about the difference between observable sciences and unobservable sciences. The former is physics, chemistry, engineering, and in general things we can measure or reproduce.

The latter includes evolution, Big Bang, and all the other controversial stuff.

I think his argument of why those didn't happen is logical. In fact it's pretty much just Bayesian statistics. We gather evidence and we add those to a prior. We come to the conclusion that is either most likely, requires the fewest assumptions, or some other means of deciding which is ""best"".

Evolutionary biologists have of course constructed a large theory with which the gathered evidence is consistent. Most people, including myself, believe this is the most likely. I however, am not above saying there is a chance it is just completely wrong. Again, unobservables.

For Ken Ham he includes the Bible in his prior. With the Bible in his prior, the story as told in the Bible of course becomes the most likely, and has the bonus of not requiring any assumptions other than the validity of the Bible as a source. In fact it's the only logical conclusion.

The only hole I could really find with his argument was the assumption that the Bible was correctly transcribed for two centuries, a series of events he could not have observed. But this is more or less inconsistent with his axioms, and I don't think flies as a counterargument.

This is motivated in part by a lot of CMVers with the notion that science is inherently superior to religion. I either want to have MV C'd, or open other peoples' minds about taking science  religion as granted.

"My view is that, in Western society, conventionally attractive females have an easier go of things than everyone else.

My first observation is that quality of life improves with a wider social circle, which attractive people at least have a greater potential for. There are more opportunities for networking / employment, a stronger emotional safety net, and a wider pool from which to select and develop close relationships (in other words, they can afford to be choosey about their friends, lovers, etc.)

My second observation is that men are usually brought up to ignore or otherwise not respond as strongly to each others' level of attractiveness. Classic female icebreakers - ""You're so pretty!"", ""I love your hair!"" - don't really exist in the straight male world, and even attractive men have to rely on other factors (humour, athleticism) to maintain their social standing among both sexes.

"In this post I am going to be very blunt. This is because I want to show exactly how all this impacted the thinking of myself and the people around me. I was born here in the US but I am of Chinese and Thai descent. As a child I grew up not really caring at all about race, I just sort of assumed humans came is all different colors and shapes and that was normal. I didn't even know there were names for the different races and ethnicities. The only thing I was really aware of was if people actually came from a different country.

As I grew older, my classmates and I were bombarded with racial messages during school and everywhere else. We were taught that white people were somehow inherently racist. We were taught that everyone else was perfect and every bad thing they did throughout history was somehow righteous and justified. I started to see lines forming. White kids were told that they were somehow responsible for everything some people in the past did. Black kids were taught that they were owed something. I noticed kids start self-segregating. It wasn't anything dramatic, no one attributed this to the things we were being taught, but people knew they were different now. 

I grew older still. I started paying attention to the news and the internet,. Race was discussed alot. I learned about affirmative action and it made my blood boil. If you didn't know, Asians are hurt the most by affirmative action. I would need a MUCH higher SAT score and GPA than a black person to get into the schools of my choice. I started to resent black people for this. Why was I being hurt because an entire race was apparently performing poorly and my entire race wasn't? And if discrimination was the reason, well my race was discriminated against in the past too! This was opinion shared by my friends. It led us to think that if this was the case, black people didn't try very much and were lazy in school. Otherwise why would they need help? I was infuriated to learn that a black girl who took all level classes and wasn't even close to the top of the class was accepted into my first choice college while I was not, despite my excellent grades and test scores. When I went to college, I made sure to avoid going to black doctors and other black professionals for fear than they got their position due to unfair preferences.

I learned about the black crime rate, and prison population. I started to become scared when I saw a black person on the streets. All the commentary about how this was racist merely solidified my opinion. I saw how violent black neighborhoods are, I was catcalled constantly by black men in the streets, I worked in a leasing office and saw black tenants who lived entirely off the government and complained about everything. If I hadn't heard about race my entire life I would have written all these off as ""Man those specific people suck"" rather than lump the entire race together. People address these issues as if everyone else is to blame for these peoples actions, instead of saying hey, those are just bad people. Instead they make it a race thing where those bad people are actually VICTIMS. I heard about the police shootings and the publicity around them. I heard about the riots, and the more people talked about how the senseless destruction was justified the more I distanced myself and the more scared I became. I started to involuntarily see black people as a threat. My friends all secretly talked about how they wished all these people would go back to Africa so we could all live in peace. In the past couple years after all the discussion about race I have seen SOO many non-black people become essentially racist, and so many wonderful black people become entitled and vitriolic.

So basically, I feel like if we brought our kids up to not see color and talk about Americans as Americans, rather than african-american, asian american, etc, racism would soon become a thing of the past. If we keep bringing up race in EVERYTHING, kids start drawing lines and lumping people together as their race, rather than as Americans. They start noticing and being hyper-aware of differences between races. Crying racism in every situation just annoys people and defeats the goal of ending racism. Racial and diversity programs make people resentful, and make the benefitting parties feel entitled. People should be chosen on merit alone. ""Not seeing color"" is treated as ignorant and is laughed at, but I feel that this is the best way to operate if we are ever going to solve our problems.

I'd like other opinions on this because the way I see the world right now truly sickens me. I don't want to keep feeling like I am different because I am Asian, I want to feel American and be okay with the way people talk about race. I want to feel okay with the way we as Americans are dealing with these issues. I also want to understand why ""not seeing color"" is ridiculed.",{'men'}
"My reasoning behind this is, for the most part the above authors lack lessons. While they don't all always, the biggest thing teachers enjoy is pointing out the themes behind each book. Why do themes matter? Why should students learn about literature in the past when we learn about the past from History?

Dr. Seuss's books contain lessons. Being yourself, being creative, not being an asshole, caring about the planet, etc.

I'm not picking out those authors exclusively, they're just some examples I thought of since I've read some of their works and I was disappointed (I guess you could say I had Great Expectations) because I'm in school to learn, and most of these books are rather dull and don't teach me anything besides themes that parallel from human nature back then to now. It's annoying reading Of Mice and Men and seeing all of these themes about friendship and loyalty in the great depression and not coming out a better person after reading it. You could stretch for several lessons but they're mostly reiterations of the themes. 

So I feel like the school system is failing me by dulling me down with pointless ""theme-based"" literature rather than literature with lessons and morals that could prepare us for the world we're gonna face. Not just themes in the world we can relate to, but how to not be a dick or how to plant a tree or stay creative while aging seem pretty important. 

So in order to not completely hate the school system and rant at my teacher and probably not do any homework based on the theme-based literature, CMV.

For clarification, USA high schools. Not sure how other countries do their classes but our English classes have mandatory books read throughout the country. It's hard to find someone who hasn't read (or Sparknoted) Of Mice and Men, the Catcher in the Rye, Catch 22, and a bunch of Shakespeare stuff from middle/high school

"I did not know this was an unpopular opinion until recently. Basically my stance is as follows.

People in their late teens are fully physically developed and have all the qualities that other adults find sexually appealing. They are sexual beings both physically and mentally. So it is evident to me that the Natural Order of Things supports my view.

Feel free to correct me if I am wrong but, for all of human history up until recently people regularly married people in their late teens and they were seen as adults. I think the change in perception can be attributed to three things:

1. People now marry later in life, the norm in this culture is to sleep around when they are younger. Adding on to that...

2. We have a hookup culture. In the past people may have been more serious about relationships (feel free to correct me if I am wrong) but nowadays a lot of people just hook up and marry when they want to ""settle down"" later in life. As a result people more readily assume that anyone interested in a younger person is up to no good and isn't serious. Which is probably the source of aversion to this kind of attraction; because they want to protect them.

3. People nowadays do not consider people in their late teens to be adults while in the past they were. I think this could be a result of how present society coddles people even through their college years whereas many later-year teens have the potential to be a functional adult with a job, spouse and kids if raised differently. Probably a result of people getting married later in life which is a result of promiscuity due to culture and availability of contraception.

Furthermore I would actually assert that forbidding relationships based on age, given that both are ready physically and mentally for that kind of relationship, is immoral; because you are stepping in the way of love, no one is getting hurt (besides pain of breakup if that happens), etc.

So basically the only thing I see that supports the argument against my view is that culture opposes it. While culture and soceity's rules may be influenced by truth, they are arbitrary. Society's rules are nothing in the face of objective truth (refer to my statement about the Natural Order of Things above) If they are not molded after it already. Adding on to this, I've heard (again, feel free to correct me if I am wrong) that women's brains become fully mature at ~17 and men's brains become fully mature at ~23. Its why in the past, men were legally considered minors at a later age than women were. If you make the argument that someone cannot rightfully enter a relationship with an adult until their brain is fully mature, you would be forced to also agree that ~17 y/o women should be available and that men should not be available until ~23. My own solution to this is that maturity in decision making is not wholly dependent on this one variable. Many adults don't make very ""adult"" decisions and many teens make responsible, ""adult"" decisions. This is, instead, something to assess regarding the individual, which applies to people 20+ as well.

Also I do not believe that such relationships hurt anyone by default. One person may be more inexperienced but that is a vulnerability that the other person does not have to exploit if they are a decent human being after the right thing.

A bit of context: I'm a 21 y/o college student and do find myself attracted to people in their late teens, as well as adults. I feel that this is normal and natual and not a fetish or somehing that is uncommon. I do not get off on domination or whatever like some people think those who have this attraction do. I just find that my brain recognizes those people as fellow adults. I'm also not looking to hook up, I'm a actually abstaining from sex until marriage and take all my relationships seriously; no ""spring flings"" or whatever for me.

My grandparents met and started dating when grandma was 16 and grandpa was 21. They were and are both very happy and have a good marriage. Imagine if they had dismissed each other as unavailable or were prevented from being together. (Refer to how I said that this kind of prevention is immoral).

ELI5 TLDR: People in their late teens many times cannot be differentiated from other ""adults"" if you did not know their age. So it is normal to be attracted to them and the current taboo is only a recent, arbitrary social rule based on nothing more than culture.

"I just had my dad tell me to lower my voice during an argument, but often I'm not even aware I'm raising it.

I, personally, don't think raising your voice during an argument is a bad thing - when you're angry, you often can't talk calmly and it's fucking stupid to call someone out on something that's completely normal to do when they're upset, particularly in the way that my dad called me out, namely, ""Am I raising my voice? I'm talking to you in a normal voice"". I think it's a normal reaction, and it shouldn't be seen as something we need to tone down (unless we are in, say, a public place). When you're angry, you're by definition unable to be calm, and yet people treat it as some sort of heinous fault.

Although I would happily call someone who went from being a man to a woman (- for example) a woman to their face and when talking about them, I still don't believe they are truly that gender. Despite having surgery, having that mindset and having hormone treatment, I can't feel fully comfortable referring to them as a woman - just from a technical standpoint.

"(At least not at the collegiate or professional level)

My younger brother and I were listening to a story on the radio regarding a controversy concerning a transgender high school student not being allowed to tryout for a female sport (softball, I believe).

My brother, who is 6'4 230lbs, just recently gave up competitive boxing. For a while there was some hope that he would turn professional, but he just couldn't seem to get over the hump. While he couldn't quite make the cut in men's heavyweight boxing, I'm sure he'd absolutely dominate women in that weight class. He joked that, if they allow this, he should become a trans woman boxer.
He would never do this and was just joking (sorry if it seems insensitive), but I'm sure that there are some opportunists out there that would. Allowing them to do so would surely ruin women's sports.

For the record, I have no problem with a transgender man playing men's sports, just like I have no problem with a female playing men's sports (if able to compete on that level).

"I don't see any reason why people would be sympathetic towards others, or nice or caring towards others unless there's a certain expectation that they will be treated the same by them. Perhaps not directly, vis-a-vis. That is, that just because you do something nice for someone that someone owes you someway. But unless you have a certain guarantee that you will be treated like a peer by those people, I don't see why you'd treat them better than they'd treat you.

For that reason, people who are pariahs have no reason to be sympathetic or nice towards other people. Sure, there's the common courtesies that are unavoidable unless you want to raise a stink wherever you go; but other than that, going that extra mile to be ""the nice guy"" or being sympathetic to the troubles of other people who look down on you? It's irrational. Why should you treat them better than they treat you, if there's no guarantee that you will be treated the same? Moreover, there's a chance they'll mistreat you, due to your pariah status.

I see this comment about being ""genuinely nice and sympathetic"" and ""treating people nicely"" about those socially-inept men whom people call Nice Guys, or otherwise loners and social rejects that always strikes me as completely absurd. Why would they treat other people with more respect, sympathy and niceness than that with which they are treated by their peers? That's a very serf-like.

"So I'll start off by saying that in no way am I promoting the ""gluten free diet"" or any other so called ""fad"" diets such as paleo, keto etc...
Essentially my viewpoint is that making fun of, or telling an individual who chooses to follow these diets that they are naïve and trying to convince them not to follow them is just as bad as making fun of, or saying the same things to a religious individual, such as a Muslim or Jew who cannot eat pork or must eat halal, or kosher food.
In both instances there is no general scientific consensus that agrees with the choices the individuals make; however, in both cases the individuals feel good about their choices whether it be because they feel like they are following the will of their God, or because they believe they are eating healthier. I do make an exception for diets which are unsustainable and will eventually cause either malnutrition or an eating disorder etc… but some diets, such as gluten free or dairy free, do not cause this issue, and the individuals feel great when they do it, whether or not it is a placebo or a result of other factors is irrelevant. I see a lot of hate on people who follow these diets on the internet and in person and I don’t really understand why. If the individuals is an adult and chooses to practice this lifestyle we should respect it as much as we respect individuals who practice their religions. In both cases I agree that if they shove it in people’s faces and try to convert people they know, it is annoying, but if they keep to themselves and understand that it is not for everyone, I don't see a reason for all the hate on people who follow these lifestyles.

"I think you probably shouldn't own a dog - except maybe you are blind, an old-school shepherd or train them for finding people after avalanches or earthquakes. I have several reasons to holdthis view - here they are, sorted by relevance (from least to most relevant). 

 They eat poo.
 They are annoying. Many people have really strong opinions against smoking in public, because it is upsetting them and accordingly laws have been past in many countries that limit/prohibit smoking in public transport, public buildings, etc. However, it is not uncommon to be leg-humped by a dog in the bus, or step into dog-poo in the park, which I find really annoying. This seems to be regarded as unproblematic, some pepole even get annoyed if you do not want to touch their animal companion with questionable hygiene standards. You may say that (contrary to smoking) these are merely inconveniences, but in fact...
 ...Some dogs are plain dangerous. Have a look at the ""Fatal dog attacks""(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_dog_attacks_in_the_United_States) wiki entry. Granted, there are MUCH more people dying from cars, cigaretts, cancer (and that's only deadly stuff with a C), etc. but in my opinion even one person would be too much. There are a lot of young children on the list as well. 
 My rant so far may have given you the opinion that I just hate animals. However, the opposite is true - I love them! Therefore I think we shouldn't keep them for our amusement or because we fancy a walk once or twice a day. 
 They eat. In a world where people are starving this is in my opinion morally not justifiable. 
 Most importantly: They produce greenhouse gases - and quite a lot of them! The co2-""paw print"" of a big dog that gets fed mostly meat may even be bigger than the emissions caused by an SUV.

Therefore I am convinced that you probably shouldn't own a dog. I will not be convinced by single examples where a dog was useful, but by reasons why the overall benefits of private dog-owenership surpass the negetive effects I have listed above. Please CMV!

()The fanatic dog-loving may be an issue particular to Germany.



EDIT: Deltas have been awarded to the argument that dogs ""sage lives"" by providing companionship, and helping with mental as well as physical health issues. It may therefore be argued that these safed lives make up for the harm that dogs cause elsewhere. Thanks to /u/stoopydumbut, /u/RustyRook, and /u/jiw123. (Others have also made the same point later).

"Lil Dicky’s debut album, Professional Rapper, debuted atop the Billboard Rap Album chart, and at number 7 on the Billboard 200, with sales of 22,000. It features guest spots from Snoop Dogg, Fetta Wap, Rich Homie Quan, Jace (from Two-9), and T-Pain. Yet /r/hiphopheads, arguably the best place to discuss rap &amp; hip-hop on the internet, forbids all discussion (whether it be links or even discussion threads) regarding his music. If I’m not mistaken, there are two reasons for the ban:

 Someone in his camp posted one of his videos to Reddit, and either LD or that someone asked their friends to upvote the video. This was claimed to be vote manipulation a or publicity stunt.

 LD is making a mockery of the genre (a hip-hop Weird Al, so to speak) and isn’t a “real” rapper.

First, there’s never been proof (from what I can tell) that LD or his camp took part in malicious vote manipulation. It doesn’t seem at all like he’s rap’s /u/Unidan. Second, /r/HHH allows links and discussion threads for The Lonely Island. That alone should indicate at least a slight bias against LD’s music.

I’m not an LD Stan or anything; if anything I lean towards some of Fantano’s critisicms of him( http://www.theneedledrop.com/articles/2015/8/lil-dicky-professional-rapper). I’m just saying that the dude’s got the best-selling rap album in the country until Dre’s numbers come in for Compton. He clearly has fans, probably a bunch on /r/HHH, and obviously a bunch on Reddit as a whole. If you want to karma-earning links because of “vote manipulation,” I disagree because of a lack of proof but I suppose that’s not that outrageous. But a complete ban (including discussion threads for fresh releases and albums) is overkill and unnecessary.

"Making the decision to have children is ethically unjustifiable.

Bringing a child into this world cannot be justified due to a human beings capacity to experience suffering. If you bring a child into this world, it is pretty much a given that it will suffer in some way - and many times, this suffering can be catastrophic. Put simply, there is no way to justify this suffering when it can be so easily avoided by simply not having babies.

By ""suffering"" I mean anything and everything - from something as simple as a cold, to anxiety about money, suffering from severe illness, becoming homeless, stress and any number of other things that can cause suffering in a person's life.

Bringing a child into this world makes you responsible for all the suffering throughout a child's life - had you not taken the decision to have a child, the child would not have suffered, because he would not exist.

This is exacerbated by the fact that the ""default position"" for humanity is suffering. By this I mean that if you do absolutely nothing, you will suffer. You have to exert a great deal of effort not to suffer - you need to constantly provide yourself with food, shelter and protection - if you don't you will starve, get cold, etc. This means that by bringing a child into the world, you are forcing them to exert effort to prevent themselves from suffering.

This may be justifiable if we were given the option to ""opt out"", but we are not. People will do everything in their power to prevent people from opting-out (and by this I mean taking one's own life). Examples: even on a forum as open as Reddit, we are still forbidden to discuss opting out. Anyone who has taken the decision to opt out and wants to find out how to do so quickly and painlessly will find themselves unable to do so. Medicines that give this option are strictly controlled, with harsh penalties for breaking the laws. Jumping spots are patrolled or fenced off. Anyone attempting to discuss opting out openly risks being detained in a medical institution against their will and possibly even forcibly medicated.

A common response to this argument is, ""Look at all the joy and beauty that can be experienced in life"". My counter-response is that such joy is not a given, as suffering is. Additionally, if one wishes to experience many of the good things in life, they have to exert even more effort than they do simply to hold off their suffering. The probability of experiencing suffering, and the amount of suffering likely to be experienced is also greater than that of the probability of experiencing joy, given that suffering is the ""default state"".

Another argument against that is that anyone deciding not to have children simply cannot be held responsible for depriving a person of joy - since such a person does not exist.

There is also no good reason to bring children into this world in despite of suffering. The future of humanity is often bought up, but none of us have any reasonable interest in the future of mankind since none of us will be alive to experience it. It's a moot point. Nobody will suffer if humanity comes to an end due to people not having babies.

"Help please change my view. 

First off, here are my reasons:

1) It's too expensive. Many college graduates have a huge amount of student debt, and many students dropout because of financial problems. 

2) I'm not smart. I'm a senior in high school. Actually a senior with junior credits. I'm missing 1.5 credits. 1.0 for math and 0.5 for Biology. I see college is for people who are lucky, smart, or rich. Most smart kids from my school were given scholarships because well... they were smart. The lucky few are people who are in sports and sometimes people like that little kid who went to McDonald's for some light to do his homework. And for the rich kids, obviously they have the money to get in there. From what I heard from other people, college won't take you if you're SATS aren't great or your GPA isn't up to par. I was really discouraged about that. Me unable to attend college because I'm not good at one subject. 

3) A huge waste of time. Many jobs requires a minimum of a high school diploma. As I start researching the jobs that I wanted, I started to slowly realize that most of the job I need requires a college degree. I really wanted to take Filmmaking, but I heard rumors about why taking it isn't worth it. But that's a whole different story. And another one is, I wanted to be a cop. I heard from other people that in order to be a cop, you need a college degree. And as stated in reason 2, I don't think I'm able to go to college to be a cop or a filmmaker because I'm broke and ""not smart"". 

I'm joining the Air Force, and I know the military can help you with education student loans and all that, but once I start thinking about it, it goes straight to reason 2. I'm plain out stupid. No matter how much time I spend studying math or being tutored, I can never get it. Math isn't for me. 

Money and math is the only thing that is stopping me going to college.",{'his'}
"First, I make the assumption that there is a very large intersection between people complaining about Cecil the lion's death, and people who eat meat.  Given the prevalence of meat consumption in the U.S., and the popularity of the outrage toward the incident, I think this is a reasonable assumption.  Keeping that in mind, here are my arguments, in order of importance.  

1) Cecil was 13 years old.  Males rarely even live to this age in the wild, so it was very likely that he would have soon been killed by another lion, had he been left alone.  Therefore, the damage done to the species is negligible.  

2) Meat production necessitates production of methane, which is 25 times more more potent are very high producers of methane, and animal agriculture is responsible for 26% of methane emissions in the U.S.  

Ruminant meat production (beef, lamb, bison, goat, etc.) also emits an extremely large amount of CO2, which is the most familiar greenhouse gas in popular discourse.  Even pork and chicken emit 6 and 3 times, respectively, as much CO2 as vegetarian protein options.  

Meat is unnecessary for a healthy diet, and there's a lot of evidence that cutting out red meat (the meats which make up the lion's share, pun intended, of greenhouse gas emissions) is actually beneficial to human health.  There's also growing evidence that methionine restriction is beneficial to humans.  All animal proteins from mammals and birds are high in methionine, plant proteins are low in it.  

By eating meat on a regular basis, particularly red meat, one directly exacerbates global warming, which would not only severely threaten the lion population, but also most complex life on earth.  

3) Meat production also takes up far more space per calorie and per unit protein than plant production.  This means that native wild fauna are prevented from returning to their natural habitat, and if demand for meat rises, that they are also further pushed out of any remaining habitat they have.  

4) The dentist who shot the lion paid $50,000 to have that privilege.  The GDP per head in Zimbabwe is about $950, so his actions put 50 people's annual salaries into the country.  

In summary:  The lion was old, and had little value to the species.  Eating meat severely endangers all life on earth.  Eating meat also means further destruction of wild animals' habitats for pasture land.  The dentist also brought a large sum of money into the local economy in order to shoot the lion.  

Therefore, anyone who is morally outraged about Cecil the lion's death and also eats meat regularly, particularly beef/lamb, is a hypocrite.  Thus, the majority of the outrage comes from a place of emotion (discrimination), and is not morally justified.

"There's a lot of people claiming to be agnostic atheists instead of atheists. This might have to do with the hateful and condescending views of the vocal minority of atheists. Atheists claim to be agnostic atheists, as if being an agnostic atheist is better than being an atheist.

However, I think most if not all atheists are agnostic. If we found undeniable evidence that God exists (e.g. He appears from the sky surrounded by golden light), then most atheists, agnostic or not, will believe that God exists. In other words, atheists don't believe in God simply because there isn't sufficient evidence. No one is saying with 100% certainty that God doesn't exist.

"Hi, i am a 22 years old agnostic living in a conservative Muslim country that is considered a bit modern and open mind compared to other Muslim countries (Tunisia), i've said that so you know that my opinion is not based on religious rules, however it heavily depends on cultural traditions and moral codes that has been implemented into my way of thinking since i pop-up into this world (yeah that sounds a lot like a religion, it just doesn't include an invisible overpowered sky-man) 


Anyway, i'll try to keep this as short as possible and sum up my view toward this subject.


In our culture, a successful person is one who has a successful family, that include having a good job, good wife/husband a decent house and if you're good enough you'll have your own house and a car (yup, that's the dream of 90% of people here) so being raised with that goal in mind, anything that you do that could be considered a threat to that goal is considered super bad one of these many things is non-virgin girls, to be more precise, girls who lost their virginity in a non-marital relationship, these women are considered a no-no for marriage and the main two reasons here are religion and men's ego (i honestly believe that religion is made of men's ego so there is only one reason here...) anyway, so far i've been only talking about rules made by invisible people and what men wants, i completely ignored the women perspective here and the fact that this is their body, their choice and they can do whatever they want to, and am okay with that! i won't condemn a girl just because she slept with some guy and stone her to death, i won't even look down at her, but i can never imagine myself marrying her, why? because i cannot stand the fact that someday, someone, could look at me and say: 
""your wife was great 2 years ago ;) ""  

That's not cool bro, it's very embarrassing, and yup, the counter-argument for this would be : 

your wife is your life partner, not an object that you own


well, i don't want anybody to fuck my partner o_O !! even in the past when we didn't even knew each other, that's my view on this. 


Also, another argument that i would like to hear your opinion about is that i don't want to live in a society where kids are having sex, no offense but, 16 and pregnant(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_and_Pregnant) has 5 seasons! and i read all the time about 12,13,14,15 years old kids having sex, and i believe the reason this is happening is due to this ""openness"" that western countries have about sex and that's why this kind of things is very rare in a conservative society, this is the only positive point that i can come up with regarding my view on the subject, the rest is like i said, a pure ego of a selfish men dominant society, but if it protect our kids, i think it's worth it, it's also the reason of a an ultimate boring amateur sex life which is the main reason of cheating and divorce but that's an after-marriage subject lol.


So, western men (or anyone who is okay with non-virgin wives) how can you change my view on this ?

It seems that i missed a point that come up to many of you here : 
Man virginity. 

Yes, ideally a man should stay virgin too, and from a religious perspective he'll had the same punishment as the women which is 100 lash, no idea where the stoning come from but again ignore the religion crap and no none of this happen in my country/culture, however, due to other facts like men are more likely the ones who had the job and the money, and that men are the one who have the option to ""look out"" for their future wives, this will make women more vulnerable to this virginity rules, since they are the one who wait and just decide to say yes or no, while men have the ""option"" to choose, which make the pre-marriage sex ""sin"" for men a lot less important compared to women, and of course you cannot ignore the ""physical evidence"", since we are far from living in an ideal world, a man could have sex as much as he want and just lie about it, while a woman cannot do that (well she can but most of the time they cannot)      


Another EDIT: 

Sorry but i missed another points : 
why men want to control what happen in the wife's past which back then the guy has no idea that this girl even existed. 

Well, i think it's all related to that ""life goal"", if a girl (or man) take the risk of threatening that goal by having sex then they are simply considered bad people, and no one would like to marry a bad person (i have no idea about forgiveness option though).


what if the girl was raped ? 

I personally have zero problem with that, but i think it's also a no-no thing in this culture.  


Thanks

"As a gay man, I can be extremely wary of other people for my own protection. I've always felt that homophobia is mainly a symptom of the willingness to hate other groups of people they have never met or gotten to know. Thus when I hear someone say ""I used to be homophobic until insert ""my son came out,"" or ""my friend came out"" or etc."" I assume they still are willing to hate groups of people they haven't met, it's just now that they know a gay person ""gay people"" no longer fall under that category.

While I am outwardly supportive when I run into these folks, inwardly I am uncomfortable to the point of being repulsed. Obviously it wouldn't be good to push for gay rights and then effectively punish homophobes for changing their minds towards being supportive, but it's hard to think in any way besides ""these people are still severely prejudiced or hateful, just not specifically towards me anymore, avoid avoid avoid!""

"In my opinion since a person has no say to being born into existence or not , his parents and state should provide means to continue that existence. If the individual has motivation to provide for himself this should be viewed as optional and not the default scenario. Simply put i am not responsible for having no motivation to provide for myself and since i'm born this way and i had no say into being born at at all - such state that allows my parents to have children should be held accountable. It is not individual who should be shamed for entitlement and being called lazy , it is state who should be shamed for entitlement and if parents can't entertain the idea that their children would not be intested in providing for themselves should have no entitlement for having them","{'his', 'himself'}"
"Been following the political news and had a few thoughts. It really wouldn't matter for the nation who becomes the next President. It seems like the era of great presidents (Lincoln, FRD, Teddy Roosevelt), who can truly make significant changes,  have long past. 

All of the current candidates, both Democrats and Republicans, more or less qualify to run a gov't, except probably Dr. Carson. Many of them have held high government positions (governors, senators) or high-ranking business positions (CEO's). They would know what to do as a President.

All of the important gov't positions are filled with appointed candidates (The Cabinet, Joint Chiefs, Fed Chairman, SC Justices and etc), who are typically chosen based on their actual abilities and not on their likability to the masses.

For example, say something happens to Obama and he can no longer be a president. Would anything drastic happen in the gov't? Not really, Biden would become president and business would go on as usual.

Thus whether it's the populist Sanders, the clown Trump, the crazy Cruz, the young Rubio, the old lady Clinton or the libertarian Paul, nothing spectacular or drastic would come. The nation would run its course, governed by the well established system, and not by individual people.

EDIT: I realize that many redditors sympathize with Democrats, but this discussion wasn't intended on which candidate was or could be a better president or which party was or could be a better party.

The discussion is whether or not the next President, Democrat or Republican, is capable of bringing truly significant reforms, changing the course of the entire nation. It doesn't matter if these changes go along with Republican or Democratic party lines.

EDIT 2: Ok I get it, you don't like Republicans. However this is not the point of this discussion. Please read the above material.

"I'd like to start this by clearly defining my position:

I think only cisgender, and by that I mean identifying with the gender you are born with, is a valid gender identification. I don't know if valid is the right world but it's the only one that sounds appropriate. Essentially, I think gender and biological sex are one and the same, gender is just a social construct to express our biological sex.


In every animal in nature we can find two sexes, male and female. Sometimes the sexes have similar roles, sometimes the male or the female has more important roles, it doesn't matter - It's there, and it's happening in nature. I'm not making an appeal to nature as a form of fallacy, I'm merely pointing out that it's a special pleading fallacy to think humans are special because we can get away with ignoring our biological sex. I admit that Humans have less sexual dimorphism than other animals and namely we can find, aside from physical and procreation capacities, little differences between men and women because both are capable of amazing things. I'm ok with abolishing or ignoring gender roles and allowing boys and girls to play with what they want. What we can't do is to pretend that we can magically change the sex we are born into.

To use an analogy, if I decided to transplant my nose and put some whiskers and called myself a tiger, would I be a tiger or just a nutjob? What would you consider me?

The primary argument for transgenderism is that gender dysphoria makes people feel bad about the biological sex they are born with or the gender they were assigned at birth, and therefore they have the right to identify with what makes them more comfortable. This sounds nice and reasonable, but the issue is that thinking we are something does not make us that something. I can imagine I'm a dragon in my head but that doesn't change the fact dragons don't exist and I'm still Human.

To categorize and simplify arguments:

1 - Every or most species have a male and female specimen and, regardless of what roles each one has, to think Humans are different is a special pleading, kinda like thinking Humans will forever be the best species on the universe

2 - The fact someone's brain tells them something is wrong or better doesn't mean it's true. If your brain can identify as a genderqueer or genderneutral, I don't see how I can't identify as a rock or a dragon. Why is the latter less valid? The fact the brain identifies as such doesn't mean we are such, it's irrelevant. If you are born with a penis, you are a man and if you are born with a vagina, you are a woman. There are obvious biological features specially related to procreation and body shape. Some transgender people, even those who have surgery, will forever look similar to the gender they don't want to be associated it, it's inevitable. The fact I want to change my deepest self doesn't mean I am actually doing it.

3 - Why is gender special? In short, why can't I magically change other things about myself? I look white, and I know race is a social construct - It's still a useful concept to categorize us - Why can't I identify as black even with pale skin? Why can't a redhead identify as a black hair? Why can't children identify as adults, etc.? Again, special pleading.


Oh, I also think the word cisgender shouldn't even be used.

Some notes:
- I am not promoting violence and hate against transgender people. If I meet someone who is trans, I will treat them like I treat anyone else. I can disagree with the core idea without hating the person.
- Don't bring up analogies to gay people and gay marriage because both are incomparable and completely different topics.
- Don't use ""you're a bigot"" as an argument
- My arguments have nothing to do with religion, I'm an atheist.","{'men', 'boys', 'man', 'male'}"
"I've been thinking about this one for a while. While a lot of the arguments for it (""It's the oldest profession""; ""we should have full rights to our bodies"") don't hold up too well, neither do a lot of the arguments against it. (As a side note, I'll be referring to women but all these arguments could reliably be applied to male prostitutes for the most part)

One of the most oft-touted arguments that I seem to see is that ""Women will be forced into prostitution because they have no other options"".

I fail to see this as a legitimate concern. Not because I don't think some women would choose prostitution to survive (it would happen, undoubtedly) but because I don't see how this is a bad thing. If the woman's only option was prostitution, and you take that away, what is her option now? Starvation? Homelessness? While it might cause mental damage to a woman to be forced into sex, as long as it's legal, enforced, and safe, isn't the damage likely to be far less than the mental and physical damage she'd suffer being unemployed/watching her children and herself starve/living out on the streets/whatever else she needed the funds for?

If I argued that minimum wage jobs should be illegalized because ""Desperate people might feel obligated to work them"", would that make sense? I don't think so. A McJob is a McJob, and a McBlowjob can still be a job without being intrinsically damaging to a person. One could argue that sex is still somewhat taboo, especially with strangers, and that the cultural ramifications cause shame, stress, and mental damage, but that's a part of society's problem with sex, not a problem with prostitution itself. The only argument I could think of is that a woman might be forced to give up her virginity to work, which I concede is awful and should never happen, but often does even with it illegal and if virginity and morality is the only thing standing between eating and starvation, I'm reasonably certain illegality is not going to stop many/any women.

I think a regulated, safe, and well-operated system of brothels (and only brothels, to ensure there are no dangers to streetwalkers/regulations can be easily enforced) would reduce the amount of dangers as well as offer additional opportunities. To clarify, this system would involve:

Similar regulations to the porn industry (mandatory screening for all workers, 100% condom use by 'johns', provided and required birth control, contracts either requiring abortion/absolving the secondary party of any/all liability and responsibility, physically and financially, in the unlikely event (but by law of large numbers unpreventable) double failure of condoms and birth control.

Protection, both on and immediately off of brothel grounds, by well-maintained security forces.

New legislation that ensures any fraud or intentional failure to pay (in the event some brothel didn't take money up front) constitutes rape.

Harsh crackdowns and harsher penalties for pimping, street walkers, and other institutions (""Massage parlors""). Death penalties/life sentences (where it isn't already) for human trafficking and sexual slavery, all the way down the ladder, and rehabilitation for victims of this.

(Actually, that last one would be good with or without legalized, but whatever).

What I'd like to see to Change My View (in addition to any logical moral/emotional arguments):

-Studies on legalization that prove it's not safe/causes societal repercussions more severe than the benefits.

-Studies on lack of effects (or worsening) of street prostitutes/pimp culture.

-Anything else relevant to disprove anything I've said here.

What I would not like to see:

-Outright moral arguments (""Selling your body is wrong"", anonymous/casual sex is a sin)

-Any arguments I listed above without additions (""Women will be forced into sex slavery"")

-Religious arguments

Thanks for your time :3

"It's a fairly accepted fact that humans are social creatures and like to form groups. This can have positive effects like a sense of belonging, cooperation and division of burdens. However, to make a group, each member has to have something in common, other than just being human. It could be gender, race, a common vision or belief. You get the idea.

So by uniting based on common characteristics, we automatically exclude those who don't fit the mould. Thus creating every kind of discrimination you can think of.

The worst part is, if you look at groups of people looking to reduce discrimination, they're as much as part of the problem as the original perpetrators. One example of this in action is the reporter who was kicked out of a Black Lives event in CSU. African Americans have a long history of mistreatment in the US and many have the right to be furious. But the problem is that they see all ""whites"" as being the perpetrators of this mistreatment and exacerbate the ""white vs black"" dichotomy. 

My opinion on how to solve these issues is this: I've been told that to solve problems as a couple, you mustn't make it ""you"" vs ""partner"", you have to make it ""both of you as a couple"" vs ""the problem"". So I think we should apply the same logic to racism and sexism. Women vs men and whites vs blacks (only two of the uncountable amount of dichotomies that exist) can't be solved by separating and pointing fingers at the other group, it can only be solved by uniting. There is no Us vs Them, only Us.

Perhaps you've suffered discrimination first hand (as I have) and disagree with my opinion because you want justice above all. In which case, please explain your opinion.

"So that's a pretty bold title, and I expect to get harassed, doxxed, etc which is why I made a throwaway. I'm just asking that you remain civil. As much as I try I just can't understand the other side of this argument.

Basically, I believe that rape is not a big problem on college campuses, the real problem is that no one agrees as to what consent is anymore. What sparked this was the recent news story:

http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/23709/

In this story, the woman has sex with the man, then sees him kissing another woman and decides that she was raped. It is mentioned that the woman attended a lecture where the speaker (a college administrator) said that regretting a sexual encounter means that you were raped. I think that this is a horrible definition of rape and it hurts both men and women.

Then there is the mattress girl story and the Duke lacrosse story and the Rolling Stone story, all of which were big name rape cases, all of which turned out to be false accusations.

Why does this keep happening? I believe that a large part of it is that people are operating under sexist definitions of consent and rape.

If a man and woman both get drunk and have sex, the woman can claim rape and it's all the guys fault.

If a man and woman have sex and the woman later regrets it, the woman can claim rape and it's all the guys fault.

If a man and woman have sex and the woman later is angry and wants to get revenge, the woman can claim rape and it's all the guys fault.

None of these situations are rape, but nonetheless, men have been punished for these exact situations.

In short, I believe that women are now taught to believe that if they have any regret about a sexual encounter, then it is rape. Other women have come to see that false rape claims are a powerful weapon. These cases inflate the college rape statistics. It is impossible for a man to have a one-night stand anymore without fear of being dragged through the mud and having his life ruined.

"I've tried my best to make this post as clear as possible, and I've included two sections that are very important:This view is NOT, and Things that would CMV so you can target the key points and not tangents or related issues when you reply to me.

In reddit and in many other places I've seen a lot of talk about transmedicalism, which states that if a person does not experience dysphoria (Most often specifically the part where you exerience loathing towards your bodily sex characteristics and manifest a desire to change them) they can't be trans and must therefore be cisgender. I know for a fact, that these ideas are a reaction to claims from so-called ""SJW's"" that they are some newfangled stargender, or a magigirl, or identities that seem to be, and that in many many cases actually are a call for attention or an attempted claim to oppression.

My view is that this reaction is not really representative of reality, and erases people who are most definitely LGBT+, today and in history. I recently came to this conclusion, and it does seem a bit flimsy still, so I'm really interested in hearing the counterarguments so I can either edit my view to something more fitting, learn from the counterarguments, or drop it altogether.

Here are the reasons that i believe this:

 Transvestites, people who liked to wear women's clothes and used female pronouns, but didn't mind being recognized as male when not in drag or crossdressing. Marsha P Johnson was known to be fine with male pronouns from close friends, and never sought to transition, to call her cis would still be inaccurate.

 My own experience. I know anecdotes are not evidence, but I'm explaining why I hold this view. I dunno why I've been obsessed with dresses and gowns since childhood. I came out as gay a year or so ago ad recently discovered drag, and nothing has ever felt so right, the idea of presenting as a woman while having that sort of dual gender feels like it describes me perfectly. I'm still hesitant to call myself genderqueer or genderfluid but I'm also not sure that it's accurate to call myself a guy.

  The fact that not wanting to chop one's weiner or boobs off implies that one's identity is set in stone and saying anything else is calling for attention in the transmedicalist view. I don't think you can talk about human psychology in such rigid terms.

This View is NOT

 That all non cis identities are valid. I'm not gonna defend stargender or magigirl/boy, mostly because I think those either don't exist or in the case of the latter are so close to a gender (it's literally the definition) that they might as well be binary.

 That being trans non-cis is a choice. I still think that this internal sense of how we identify is ruled by things like brain chemistry or exposure to certain hormones while in the womb (as shown by digit ratio)

 That womanhood and manhood are limited to things like clothing, makeup , and roles and stereotypes. A key thing I mentioned is that people above all want to be recognized and treated like a certain gender (through gendered words and pronouns and whatnot) and often their presentation reflects that, rather than interest int he objects of the presentation by themselves.

Things that would CMV

 If I have a fundamental misunderstanding of the point of transmedicalism, or the definition of dysphoria that they use

 If I have a fundamental misunderstanding of gender and what it means

 If my feelings and those of others are better explained by things unrelated to gender identity or being non cisgender

 If not being transmedicalist can harm trans people who suffer from dysphoria.

 And of course other things I don't know yet, but these are I think the pillars of my view.

"In the recent spy movies we've had, there are very few spies that would make good spies. 

Recent films:

 November Man: Senior CIA operative is involved with his target and tells no-one, creating a massive conflict of interest. It makes him go against his CIA superiors.

 A Most Wanted Man: Covert ops spy gets his cover blown by relatively minor political attaché working for the same government.

 RED series: zero stealth on the part of agencies in the films and the team of spies. Operative methods seem to be to blow/shoot shit up.

 James Bond Series: Gets things done but in a usually very apparent and traceable way. Prone to get dangerously sidetracked from the mission by things that really don't matter. MI6 is infiltrated pretty often in the series, and there seems to be an issue with operational stealth on their end too.

 Mission Impossible: See James Bond. Substitute MI6 with whatever Hawk works with.

 Kingsman: See Mission Impossible. Substitute MI6 with ""The Kingsmen"".

 Cold Light of Day: Agent tells a bunch of people he's an agent. 

 Bourne Series: Agency who is supposed to track Bourne is pretty bad at tracking Bourne, is infiltrated, is corrupt... Also likes to blow things up.

Spy movie is too often synonymous with action movie, and it pisses me off, since spy work is almost exactly the opposite. Tinker, Taylor, Soldier, Spy was a good one though. Most spy movies are more about super soldiers than super spies.

"Many people think that racism, sexism, ageism etc. are wrong because it is a judgment of a person based on something he can't change. I don't think that is why these prejudices are bad. I think they are bad simply because they are prejudices. I think that bringing up for example political affiliation, religious beliefs, wealth, clothing or hairstyle in support of an argument 1 is an argumentative foul and an intellectually dishonest thing to do, exploiting prejudices of people. 

I think that:

1. Arguments should be judged based on the content of the argument, not the people stating them
2. All prejudices are bad and should be fought against, without prioritizing the prejudices based on things one can't change 2

1 Of course that excludes the cases when the thing in question is direct subject of the argument - like ""John believes in God, he's a Christian"", this doesn't evoke any prejudice.

2 I am fine with prioritization based on different, better criteria, for example prioritizing prejudice which has the largest socioeconomic effect in the society (however one measures that).

"Commonly it is stated that every human has equal value, I do not believe that is the case. 

I personally do not think there is such a thing as objective value as I believe that the concept of value is a human construct. I think that the value a person possesses is determined by the value that he/she and other humans consider him/her possessing. Following that line of reasoning it is quite evident that everyone does not have equal value as everyone is not treated as if they have equal value.

Still, i would like to take it one step further and say that everyone should not be considered to have equal value. It is hard to define value but for simplicity i will use the most common social construct for value measurement: economics. I will try to explain my view with the following analogy:

You find yourself facing the option to either pay for Adolf Hitler’s or Nelson Mandela’s life. Most people would not hesitate before choosing to save Nelson Mandela. Thus they value him higher than Adolf Hitler. I would argue that this is the morally best decision.

So, am I missing some central point, or maybe I am defining value in a poor way?

"Okay, so first of all, I'm not necessarily a liberal, but I'm no conservative either. I'm sort of a mixed bag; there are some liberal things I agree with (Raising taxes on the rich, welfare, increased minimum wage, equal pay rates on both men and women although this has been a hot topic on whether it's true or not, because where I work both men and women are paid the same but I also have a few conservative views like this one; now I just want to say, I have no problem with girls playing with trucks or boys playing with dolls. However, I don't agree with Target making everything ""Gender neutral"". If someone wants to dress their boy in ""masculine"" colors or their baby girl in ""feminine"" colors, then let them do it. The same way vice-versa. However, I think that getting rid of gender specific toy aisles is stupid because it just makes it harder for parents to find their children toys; some boys want masculine toys, just like some girls want feminine toys. If a girl wants a masculine toy, the parent could easily go to the boy's section and buy a toy from there for his or her daughter; in fact, my parents did this often. However, what I don't agree with is dressing (young) boys in girl's clothes or painting his nails. I don't really think parents should be discussing this sort of thing until the child is a teenager (or around that age). Another thing I noticed is that many ""SJWs"" have said that buying masculine toys for boys makes them masculine. Surely buying feminine toys for him would make him feminine if this was the case?

"I can never understand people when they lament about how they feel sorry for someone who just commited a violent crime.

I understand being sympathetic towards a non-violent thief who might be destitute, or a murderer who has done his time and apologized.

But someone who has just done a horrible act of violence towards another person (and hasn't repented yet) doesn't deserve sympathy from anyone, unless they genuinely believe he/she is innocent, or committed the crime in self-defense.

One argument people make is that the guilty crime was committed ""in the heat of moment"". I see this often being used to defend road ragers and drunk wife-beaters. I can't agree with this argument because it unfairly takes responsibility away from the criminal. If we left every criminal go easy because the crimes were ""emotional"" or ""spur of the moment"", we'd have a lot of unstable people out on the streets ready go to off at any moment and hurt others.

Another argument I hear is that the criminal was a ""victim of the circumstances"", i.e. he was poor or grew up in a dysfunctional family. This is a totally reasonable argument if the crime is non-violent, but being poor or traumatized is not an excuse to kill somebody or even go beat someone up. Anyone who makes a conscious choice to hurt someone physically is simply an asshole.

I oppose the death penalty and am in favor of restorative prison reform, so I hear people giving these criminals moral slack (at more than just a legal or health-based level) all the time, and it drives me crazy. But I want to see the POV they are coming from, so please try to CMV.

"Every election year this is one of the most popular complaints against  candidates: lack of detailed policy prescriptions. 

 ""So and so says he's going to reduce the budget, but so far he hasn't offered any specifics.""  

 ""Hillary says she has a plan for restarting the Israel-Palestine peace process, but so far nobody has been able to nail her down on the details."" 

 Recently right here on one of the CMV posts about Bernie Sanders, /u/bayernownz1995 says that ""Sanders does have a solid page on racial injustice on his site, but it is a little weak in terms of actual policy prescriptions. Compared to O'Malley's page, Sanders has a lot of work to do.""

You hear these complaints all. The. Time. In newspapers, on blogs, on TV news, in debates, etc. Candidate X offers no details, they're evasive in answering questions, they're canny, they give bland lip service to a problem and make happy talk about solutions, but they never actually say what it is they're going to do if elected. It's like the default setting of oppo research, a ready-made criticism to hurl at a candidate if you don't have any meatier, muddier dirt to fling their way. 

But the thing is, there are very good reasons for candidates to be evasive. For one thing, if they were to offer actual policy details during a campaign, then they'd spend the entire rest of the campaign defending and arguing about those details. If someone found an error or mistake or potential pitfall, they might have to revise their plan -- revise a policy that doesn't even exist yet! Political opponents hire specialists in opposition research, and the more material those specialists have, the more they'll be able to distract and distort your candidate's plan in order to make them look bad. Giving them an entire piece of draft legislation, or an entire detailed budget document showing cuts and spending, etc. would be like a godsend to the oppo research people. And all for what? For an imaginary policy that doesn't even exist yet. No candidate in their right mind would open up so many vulnerabilities all for the sake of a policy that doesn't even exist outside of the candidate's website. 

Secondly, no political candidate is running for the office of dictator. Whether someone is running for President, Senate, Congress, Governor, state legislator, dog catcher, etc., the important thing to remember is that politicians have to work with other politicians, and agencies, bureaucracies, other constituents, etc. They have to work with other people to get anything accomplished. So if you get elected to office with a complete, massively detailed economic stimulus package combined with spending cuts and tax cuts, don't expect every other member of Congress to just roll over and rubber stamp your policy. Politics isn't beanbag, and you'd get crucified by the players in Washington (or any other capital). Oh, you promised you were going to cut the F-22 fighter? Well guess what, that's going to throw 60,000 people out of work in my district. And you want me to just vote for it because your supporters voted for you? How about f--k you?"" 

If you got elected with a detailed policy proposal, everyone in the government responsible for putting your policy into motion would have you over a barrel. Every change they make to your policy would threaten to make you a ""liar,"" a judas, a traitor, etc. to the people who supported you, as well of course as your political enemies. Your policy details would become a millstone around your neck and a gun to your head. Your friends and enemies alike would be able to use all of your detailed promises on the campaign trail in order to wrap you around their fingers.

So that's my view: politicians would be insane to offer detailed policy answers to any given question, and they are wise to stick to vague generalities, advertising language, happy talk, etc. Can you think of a good reason for politicians to spell out their promises in detail? 

EDIT -- After 16 hours, most challengers haven't dug very deep into the issue or looked at it from different angles. For instance, what about examples of actual candidates who did in fact provide detailed proposals during an election? Did they pay for it or benefit from it?

"As we all know, the viewers/stuidos/whoever were displeased with the reception of Superman Returns hence issued a reboot.  They did basically a polar opposite take with the reboot and we got whatever that Zack Snyder monstrosity.  Not only did I not like Man of Steel, but I thought Superman Returns was a decent film.

Superman Returns.  The more I rewatch it, the more I realize how they were trying to make a movie that was very authentic to the style of the Chrisopher Reeves movies.  The first thing we have to agree on is that Christopher Reeves those movies' portrayl of Superman are what everyone identifies as Superman.  So in a nod to that, Superman Returns is in that vein.  Brandon Roth carries himself a lot like Reeves did, the dialogue follows the same style, and so on.  Its a very charming and light portrayal of Superman which is how Reeves' movies did it.  The movie itself tries to never get too dark or serious, much like the originals.  Instead its about the character interaction, showing the marvelous feats, and kind of creating the world as it exists in the Superman mythos.  The movie is family friendly, funny at times, has a good cast of actors.  My only outright criticism is that they really took for granted the viewer's familiarity with the past Superman movies.  They basically wasted no time in backstory by just referencing the events of the other movies.  I think making this an extension of the Reeves films more or less outright was taking something of an extreme liberty.  

But Man of Steel is all in all a dark (literally and figuratively) film.  It gives a de jour emo  portrayal of Superman; moody, conflicted, enigmatic.  An excessive amount of time/scenes is spent on showing Superman's emotions and character building.  Christopher Reeves was just Superman, a guy who was just all-around iconic and always stood strong in the pocket.  Then Henry Cavill goes and lets his father die unnecessarily in a tornado?  Also Christopher Reeves barely cried in all four films, yet Henry Cavill has done so twice already in the first movie.  And would a Christopher Reeves movie ever end in him breaking the neck of his enemy right before a couple of children get vaporized?  The cinematography is dark and the visual effects look a lot like Green Latern (which probably isn't a good thing).  The backstory about Krypton is god-awful convoluted, unnecessary, and difficult to understand.  All the fighting seems inconsequential because aside from showing us constant grandiose destruction, we can't tell if the hits have any effect.  In the Reeves flicks, characters showed injuries, came up lame, grunted, cried out in pain.  In this one, Superman and his foes get knocked a quarter mile through concrete wall just to return the favor.  You absolutely never knew when the fight was going to end.  I could go on and on but those are some of the big points that seem to make it a lesser film to me.

"First I'm not a prude and I'm completely fine with nudity. I honestly wouldn't care if they abolished all public decency laws and everyone walked around naked. However, that doesn't change the fact that the laws exist, and are the basis of my argument. For the people who do get uncomfortable around nude breasts, a single father with his adolescent daughter, or a mother with a teenage son, or even some old stick in the mud curmudgeon, I don't think it's too much to ask to handle such things in private. Whether pumping milk, or nursing at home, there are ways of handling these things. No one else is obligated to accommodate 
public nudity. If it's not ""convenient"" for them, that's all part of the sacrifice of parenthood.

"I've always been a huge Arby's fan.  In my mind, Arby's stands head and shoulders above virtually every other fast food option.  I think their food is fresh, original, flavorful, and affordable.  If most people gave it an honest chance, they would like it.

I recently realized how poor of a reputation Arby's has when Comedy Central released a super-cut of all the Jon Stewart Arby's jokes, at one point earning himself a gag ""free Arby's for life"" card due to the sheer volume of on-air Arby's mentions.

The main criticism of these comedians is that the food is artificial, stomach busting, mystery meat.  And I think anyone who's eaten at Arby's ever knows that that's just not true.  The food is great, it doesn't taste fast-foody at all, and most of it is downright mouth watering.  I remain thoroughly convinced that, if everyone could try Arby's without all the marketing bias of a lifetime of anti-Arby's jokes, they would come away loving it.

"This CMV was sparked by the reaction to Donald Trump from the right in the recent GOP Candidate Debate but extends to everyone who intentionally used political incorrectness for personal or political gain. 

Donald Trump, who was once considered a joke candidate is now leading most polls for the GOP nomination, mostly due to his unapologetic opinions  about things and his willingness to be open about his policies and ideas. He has also said that “I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct,” and to some extent I agree; political correctness has gone too far in this country and people need to be less offended by things. However, he has used ""political incorrectness""  as an excuse for his awful behavior and comments such as the mexican rapists invading our border and how Rosie O'Donell is a ""fat slob"" and instead of facing criticism for his opinions is being championed as some sort of visionary for people who's opinions don't align with the mainstream instead of the jackass that he is.

"Having one Bernie Sanders as President is one thing but I don't think it'll result in anything even close to what his supporters would hope. 

Let's cut the cynicism for a moment and let's say that Bernie Sanders is one hundred percent dedicated and accomplishing each and every one of his goals laid out in his agenda. 

Given that the right hates this guy and the amount of corporate influence amongst the Senate (and it's not just limited to the right, I realize), I don't think it's worth being invested in who becomes President so long as the GOP remains as influential as they are in Congress. 

We don't need one Bernie. We need 100 Bernies.

"I know Sanders is probably the best candidate for BLM policies (though O'Malley is good as well), and that his supporters are probably the most likely to support BLM. This is exactly why I think he's the right choice.

First, I think it means you get less backlash against the movement in general. If she were to interrupt another candidate, more people would use that as evidence against the BlackLivesMatter movement in general. That means more people would use the incident to negatively paint the entire BLM movement since they are less familiar with it, while the Sanders supporters who would be upset would be the least likely to do this.

Second, it forces Bernie to make a bigger deal out of racial injustice in his campaign. Even if he doesn't support the people who interrupt him, he has to at least issue some statement that says ""Why'd you pick on me? Here's everything I'm doing to help . . ."" and suddenly, it's a major part of his campaign.

Sanders does have a solid page on racial injustice(https://berniesanders.com/issues/racial-justice) on his site, but it is a little weak in terms of actual policy prescriptions. Compared to O'Malley's page(https://martinomalley.com/policy/criminal-justice/), Sanders has a lot of work to do. Interestingly enough, O'Malley began to better flush out his policy on criminal just after he was interrupted by BLM protesters.

Forcing his hand in making his stances on racial justice more public and more thorough is the best way to make it a bigger campaign issue, and is the best possible result for the BLM movement at large.

"Allow me to clarify. I firmly believe that for many individuals, marijuana allows psychological issues one might have to surface earlier and to manifest themselves at a higher intensity than if that individual abstained from smoking in the first place. Personally, I spent my early life with a mentally unstable parent who smoked heavily in high school and to the best of my knowledge has been going to therapy and heavily medicated since early adulthood. I've watched my sibling get into pot, get depressed, attempt suicide, and have anxiety attacks. This all started once they began smoking. I have dead friends, ""burn-out"" friends and friends who smoke 420 blaziken MLG pro Monster blunts daily with minor anxiety and side-effects. My point is that while pot doesn't directly give people depression or anxiety etc. that don't already have a propensity for it, that it does help bring those (forgive my lack of better phrasing) ""disorders"" to the surface. 

Ways to convince me: Reputable studies showing people who smoke are less likely to be depressed, anxious, suicidal. A fair-logical argument will likely win me over, since all my examples are generally first-hand.


Stuff that won't work- any argument saying ""you're only one person, this is a rare extreme"" ""have you ever smoked it?"" or ""Everything you said is objective etc. etc."" I'm not saying that those pursuits are incorrect, just that it's not going to convince me.

"I have recently been told that my pro-life position is ""forcing my ideas on others"".  I believe that it is not or that if it is then it is necessary.  This "" forcing ideals on others"" is an argument I hear often and I just want to understand it better. I believe that a fetus is a human being. I confess, that is my view, not everyone's view. I believe an abortion is the murder of that child. This is still my view. Not everyone's. United States law entitles all humans to life. Passing legislation opposing abortion is simply following that idea in my way. I am not forcing anyone to agree with me. I am simply making sure the law is followed as I read it. 

For a hypothetical:

It's 1870 and there is a white who believes that black people are subhuman (not so uncommon at the time). If I say no they are not subhuman. They are human beings and I will prosecute you if you kill them am I "" forcing my ideals on them"" or am I simply protecting what I believe to be human life. And even if I am ""forcing my ideals"" on the man isn't it necessary to do so?  

The abortion debate is a matter of whether the fetus is indeed entitled to the rights of a living human. It has nothing to do with a group forcing it's ideas on another and such statements are only used to unjustly vilify the pro-life movement.",{'man'}
"Ares was the best cat ever, he was friendly and intelligent and playful. He was everything to me, and he died of an illness on the 4th. He was only 2 and a half years old. He died when I left town, I was confident his anti biotics were healing him because he seemed to be doing so much better.

He lived a good life before he died, but in his final moments he felt agony (I wasn't there). My mother said he was running from door to door, trying to get outside before he just fell asleep in the kitchen and didn't wake up. 

We may talk up JFK, Lincoln, MLK, and how meaningful their lives were all we want. In their final moments they didn't get to reflect on that, all they felt was unimaginable amounts of pain. Sure the person who overdoses might have had a good high going before they died, but that doesn't matter does it?

How we reflect on their lives isn't something they get to enjoy, honor and memory are useless to the dead. It doesn't help the men who stepped on mines that a man in uniform is marching around where they're buried in Virginia. 

This isn't just about how the fact of the matter is that Ares died young in bad sickness, but I'm left with the cold reality of that and all of the world.

The universe is an unfeeling, nonsensical, and unfair place. Look at what the entire country of Cambodia, they underwent a horrendous genocide. Countless infants were smashed against trees. Their country is still poor and corrupt and Pol Pot never faced justice, the Khmer Rouge never faced justice. That's just one spec of the pain all of humanity has faced throughout the ages. How many infants died throughout history? How many toddlers and small children died, how fucking accepted was it throughout most of history that children under 10 had a 50% of dying. 

The entire universe is tainted with mortality and randomness. We're a species that aspires for order, love, fairness, peace, and all of that it a universe and on a planet that has no function for it. 

Nothing can make me at peace with that, the pain of Ares's sad death may subside, but I'll never become at peace with the realization his death gave me. ","{'he', 'men', 'his', 'him', 'man'}"

"Or to clarify, the things that currently are generally labeled as ""PC"" are being unfairly targeted. I'm more precisely referring to elements of the modern social justice movement as well as other typically liberal movements surrounding it. 

The main impetus for my current view is that nearly entirely, when someone blames ""political correctness"" for silencing their views, those views are in some way bigoted and, for that reason, don't deserve to be taken as serious alternatives. 

A recent example where I noticed the idea that political correctness is a negative being employed is when Donald Trump countered Megyn Kelly's question over his crude remarks against many prominent women, by not only doubling down on them but also promising that he won't succumb to political correctness. I found this an obvious and cheap attempt to justify his own misogyny. 

Of course, accusations against political correctness are used elsewhere in much more subtle situations. Examples include, the American right accusing liberals of trying to disassociate Islamic terrorism with Islam itself, or any one of many other attempts to be sensitive towards particular groups of people, who, in my view are often unfairly targeted due to associations they have no control over.

Other situations where I've heard disparaging remarks against the rise of political correctness are extreme situations where it's abused to the benefit of someone that wants to sue or wants wants to take things too literally or tries to read too deeply into certain statements. I believe that those situations are in fact rare and don't represent the actual views of most self proclaimed members of the current social justice moment. For example, I think I would agree that trying to replace Santa's ""ho ho ho"" with Santa's ""ha ha ha"" wouldn't make any sense since there is no intended connection with attempts at disparaging women in that. 

I think that ultimately, today we have a society that's becoming increasingly more self-aware of its faults and has led to better work environments for women and minorities because of political correctness. It represents a step forward from when overt racism/sexism became unacceptable since we've today learned to acknowledge the effects of subconscious bias and more subtle forms of discrimination and how discrimination in the past has trickled down into elements of modern society.

Interesting questions that do arise, however, are to what extent should sensitivity in our language be promoted/enforced? Or how do you determine whether or not an offensive joke crosses a particular line? I think as long as we're not actively imposing criminal penalties to people for simply making sexist remarks, for instance, we should be fine as a free society. 

EDIT: I realize that political correctness is primarily a pejorative term used on issues related to the modern social justice movement. I should have been better with my use of terminology because of its broader meaning in the context of past social changes. My point is that what generally receives the PC label is usually a step in the right direction that is being unfairly targeted.

"Donald Trump refused to rule out a third party run in the first debate, and he obviously has the bankroll to make that happen without having to beg for money like the rest of the candidates.

This means that if the GOP don't nominate Trump, he will very likely spoil the election for them by drawing away GOP votes to an independent ticket. Even without that dynamic, it would have already been a very tough electoral race for the GOP.

So unless they nominate Trump, the GOP will definitely lose the 2016 presidential race.

If Trump does get the nomination, he could max out his electability by picking John Kasich, who is the least offensive Republican to moderates and liberals and who is also popular in Ohio, a key swing state.

That would show that Trump can make smart political decisions, which could further sway independents and moderates who are tired of establishment politics.

What's happening right now is that the GOP establishment does not like having a candidate who is not in their pocket, so they are trying to sink Trump's candidacy in favor of Jeb Bush (or maybe Rubio), who will also pick John Kasich as his running mate.

But Jeb's candidacy would be sunk not only by it being George W. Bush's brother running, but also by Trump's running and the electoral map favoring Democrats.  A Rubio/Kasich ticket or Jeb/Rubio ticket would be sunk for similar reasons.

So Donald Trump is actually the most electable Republican presidential candidate, and a Trump/Kasich ticket is the most electable Republican ticket. 

(Maybe a Trump/Floridian ticket would do as well, but it probably wouldn't be their best chance.)

"From what I have observed, liberals tend to fall into one of two categories, both of which are vehemently opposed to the other.

The first faction is heavily focused on political correctness and the “social justice” movement. They are major proponents of multiculturalism. They tend to view human social behavior as being socially constructed, and the result of the environment, and are often hostile towards evolutionary psychology. They are more focused on equality of outcome than equality of opportunity. Mainstream feminists fall into this category. They are also more likely to support gun control than the second faction. They have more female members compared to the second faction, and are more likely to be religious.
Examples of liberals in this faction include: Hillary Clinton, Laci Green, Mike Rugnetta, Trace Dominguez, PZ Myers, and Jen McCreight.

The second faction is liberal socially and economically, i.e. on abortion, gay marriage, drug liberalization, health care, etc., but is vehemently against the political correctness that the first faction espouses. They are also more averse to multiculturalism than the first faction. They tend to seek biological explanations for human behavior, and are more accepting of evolutionary psychology. They are more focused on equality of opportunity than equality of outcome. Almost all of the members of this faction are atheists. This faction is much more heavily male dominated than the first faction. They are also more likely to support gun rights compared to members of the first faction. They also tend to be more likely to criticize mainstream democrats, such as Barack Obama. Examples of liberals in this faction include: Richard Dawkins, George Carlin, TJ Kirk, Phil Mason, and Carl Benjamin.",{'male'}
"To get this out of the way early: This is not going to be a PCMR circlejerk. An unnecessary reminder: this subreddit is for reasoned persuasion, not mutual masturbation. 

I'm talking strictly about advantages in professional, competitive, skill-based, PvP shooters given by playing at a lower resolution, taller aspect ratio (4:3 vs 16:9), or narrower FOV (excepting personal tolerance for distortion). 

This is the photo that prompted my question.. 

Points of confusion:

 With upscaling disabled, the pixels are the same size as they would be if he were playing at native resolution, so there's no 'zoom' offered. 
 Lower resolution means, definitively, less rendering precision. If an enemy's head is visible over an edge at distance, it may not take up enough of the player's FOV to be rendered (possibly an unlikely example). Also, the player is less able to aim in small increments. These are non-issues issue at 1080p+ resolutions. 
 UI elements (note especially the map and kill feed in the linked photo) are measured in pixels, and so obscure a HUGE percentage of available vision. This is greatly reduced by having more pixels on the screen.
 Horizontal FOV (at a given level of distortion) suffers because of the narrower 4:3 aspect ratio. Limited peripheral vision is an obvious disadvantage that's very simply fixed with a widescreen 16:9/16:10 aspect ratio.

"I'm from Australia where we grow up with cricket rather than baseball. The fundamentals are the same: a pitcher throws a ball at a batter, who hits the ball between fielders and then runs to a goal to score points.

But cricket is superior to baseball in every way. The fielders don't wear gloves. They cover more ground. The batter is allowed and encouraged to hit the ball in a 360 radius from where he stands, compared to 90 degrees in baseball. The field is far more customisable, making allowances for left-handed batsmen and bowlers (pitchers), the bowler himself, the weather conditions, the shape and size of the ground itself, the state of the match. Baseball field positions are more or less static. With the exception of an occasional bunt in baseball, it is more or less all out attack, whereas cricket teams must make constant adjustments to their strategy. Often cricket teams won't even try to get a batter out. 

The area at which a baseball pitcher must aim is extremely small, limiting the number of ways the batter can deal with a ball in the 'strike zone.' Conversely cricket bowlers can and do aim at a batman's body in order to intimidate them, or pitch the ball in other areas in order to entice them to play risky shots that are likely result in an out. That is to say, the rules of cricket allow for players to have a much wider spectrum of playing styles than baseball does.

Innings are longer in cricket which allows 'relationships' to develop between batters, and tactical battles to evolve between opposing batters and bowlers. In baseball a pitcher and batter will only face each other for a theoretical maximum of 54 pitches per game (the reality is far, far less than this), whereas it is common in cricket for one batsman to face one bowler for hundreds of deliveries (pitches) per game. Cricket batsmen can choose whether to run or not, which requires a whole extra layer of strategy from both teams.

There is more. Cricket is to baseball as chess is to checkers. What does baseball have over cricket?

"This is purely from anecdotal, self researched and experiential  knowledge, so feel free to correct me if there are any glaring issues in my position. I believe that some of the social welfare programs in the United States could be reformed to give jobs, education, and training to low-to-none income individuals and families as opposed to handing out checks. I believe that this would be beneficial because:

1. Living off a free welfare check sometimes decreases an individual's drive to work and better themselves; and by extension to increase their standard of living

2. Providing job training and/or an education to underprivileged individuals allows for the betterment of the individual - increasing ambition, social ability, financial stability, and other benefits

3. Providing job training and/or an education to underprivileged individuals allows for the betterment of the society - increasing the education of American society as a whole, decreasing unemployment and crime rates

4. I believe that there is enough money (read: safety net programs budget in the US; http://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-where-do-our-federal-tax-dollars-go) that will be freed up in order to allow this reform

One example was that a youtuber I watch (He wouldn't lie about said things because his whole channel is about social issues and such, and hasn't lied about anything yet. MrRepzion is that guy). He was in a bad relationship and decided to end it. Now the girl was very upset, so upset that she decided to create a fake rape claim, and the only reason Repzion was found guilty, was that his ex mistakenly decided to tell him over text that she claimed a false one, so he had evidence that it was false. Another one was an old friend of mine (17) was dating a 15 year old from my school. He broke up with her, and then filed a false statutory rape case against him, with parental help. Which he plead guilty.

~~I also bring up abolishing statutory rape laws because I see no use for them. If the sex is consensual, then there shouldn't be any punishment, because both parties wanted it, and with how they are set up, I guarantee that the guy will almost always be the one being punished, with the girl off scotch free. And if the sex wasn't consensual, then it should be considered just rape, rendering the statutory rape law useless.~~ Realized this would never be okay.

"With the media covering police killings and the fact that United States Law enforcement kills a relatively large percent of its people every day I believe there should be more repercussions to an officer that kills a citizen.

The benefits to having a process like this includes:

1. No hypocrisy. All because someone has the title of a law enforcer doesn't mean that they shouldn't follow the same legal process as a citizen would. I mean, what if an officer showed up to the scene of a shooting (in which the shooter called 911 for help) and the shooter was there with the weapon and openly admitted to killing the victim in self-defense (which upon observation it was blatantly obvious it wad self-defense)? Surely the officer would draw his/ her weapon at the murderer and scream to get down. They would proceed to cuff them and bring them to the station for booking/ questioning. If an officer called in for back-up after killing someone (even if was obviously out of self defense) they would be approached with ""hey are you okay?"" and ""Let's get the paperwork out of the way so you can have your paid leave."" That to me is hypocritical. Take away the uniform and you have a person who just killed another person.

2. It would make officers think twice before drawing. If they knew they would be processed and charged with murder, I would argue that there would a significant decline in police shootings.

3. It gives the victim a fair chance at their side. Even if they are dead, treating an officer like a criminal discredits any story they come up with giving a better chance for the true series of events to surface. We have seen A LOT of cops make up shit that ""justifies"" the killing when later proved wrong by cameras. If people could just make up stories and be believed 100%, I could go outside right now, shoot someone in the head while no one is looking, plant a knife, claim they came at me with a knife, and get away with 2nd degree murder.

Even if an officer witnessed another officer kill a person when it was blatantly self-defense (eg the person had a gun pointed at the officer) they should still be cuffed and taken in. Just apply the same situation to 2 citizens, surely the one who lives would be charged with murder and only the results of an investigation would set them free.

I'm just frustrated with all the bull shit I hear about cops and would like to hear the logic of the other side because I feel I'm blinded from it. So CMV.

Edit: Okay, too many people are correcting me on minor technicalities which isn't helping. You cannot deny that there is an obvious bias when it comes to determining if an officer killing someone is justified or not, at least compared to a citizen killing another citizen. I just believe that bias should not exist.",{'murderer'}
"I don't see an issue with children being raised to use the first names of their parents in interaction, if that's what that particular family is comfortable with. I view it as a personal choice. While I don't think or feel any kind of way toward other parents wanting to be known to their children simply as mother/father, the idea has never resonated with me and I would personally prefer to be called my name.

Offspring can easily acknowkedge a parent's role in their lives without referring to them only by the title of their relation to them in every interaction. To me, little would change. I see it as a matter of parental preference, like the kind of car driven. I can retain my individual identity without it interfering with or undermining my authority. If anything, I think that's a valuable lesson for a growing person to understand.

I don't think simply being/not being called mother or father augments respect, bond or parental relationship dynamics if that is the family understanding. Of course, there is a difference when a family has an agreement to refer to the parents via parental title and the kid/s proceed to later call them by first name to ruffle feathers. That isn't the situation I'm referring to.

 The usual arguments against individuals who prefer to be called by their name rather than a generic mom/dad seem to be along the line of 'They're your child, not your friend', which in my eyes is a leap. Defining somebody by their label doesn't give their position more credence. Respect, authority, boundaries and understandings are established in countless ways more significant than being called by a title the kid should implicitly know is yours. If there is something wrong with all parties in a household being on first name basis that I am missing, enlighten me.

"I see many CMVs suggesting that tipping is bad, but growing up in a city that lives on tips and embraces tipping, I have a different view. Is my view unique to my community? Is it wrong?

I grew up in Las Vegas where most service industry jobs both allow tipping and reward tippers with excellent service. Poor tippers quickly find that their behavior will result in poor service.

For example, casinos have cocktail servers who patrol the casino bringing drinks to players. When the server brings your first drink, you should tip them something (usually at least a dollar). If you tip average or above average, the server will return in a few moments to check on you and bring another drink if you need it. If you choose to not tip, you will likely wait much longer before you see your server again.

Baggage handlers, valets, hosts and hostesses, front desk and even security are offered tips and are often empowered to enhance your experience. A brief read through the vegas subreddits (there are several) will lead you to many methods to use tips to get superior service while in Las Vegas.

I've lived in other cities and visited many, many cities, both tourist trade and non tourist areas. Overall, the communities that accept and thrive on tips have better service, happier servers and more business because of it. When I have been in areas with a mandatory service charge, I find that service is not as good.

While in New York City, I often talked to my servers about the mandatory service charges and indicated that I found it odd being from Las Vegas where tipping is encouraged. Often servers would agree to remove the service charge and allow me to tip what I wanted. This mutual trust made me memorable and my service was better because of it. I say this as I watched servers snub other patrons who did not engage the server and went with the standard charges.

I read once that Penn Jillette (of Penn and Teller) lets servers know up front that he tips 25% reguardless of their service. He claims that he has never had bad service using this method.

As to claims of tipping encouraging racism, or female and blond servers getting higher tips, I would say that this is not unique to tipping. Pretty girls get lots of perks while they are young and pretty. No cover charges, free drinks, higher tips, etc. Unfortunately for them, these attributes quickly fade over time. Not having good service skills means their tips will fall off in their 30s or 40s. Again, this is not unique to tipping, this happens in nearly all non technical positions.

As to racism, many many servers are minorities and make great tips in Las Vegas. I would suggest that Las Vegas is a bit more progressive towards minorities than other cities, so again, I believe the problem is with regressive communities, not the practice of tipping.

Help me understand why this is not preferable to not tipping or banning tipping.

"My cat just died. He was a 2 and a half year old Bengal that got stricken with a sudden sickness, and just when the anti biotics seemed to be turning him around, he died.

I'm not intelligent, capable, good looking, or anything. I've never had a gf, don't really have friends anymore, and live a solitary life. But he was my only friend, he was the best cat who never bit or hissed at anyone, and was friendly and playful even with strangers. He was the only real good thing in my life, now my awesome PC and expensive headphones don't mean anything. 

This is pathetic, I know. It's not just him, it's just that now the sun of my life is gone the darkness that really is everywhere is more apparent.

The world is a sinking ship, everyone is scrambling for a high and dry spot. You all may have some super inspirational quote to give me, it makes the whole state of the ship seem less sorry, and maybe gotten us through when we go sprinkled with water (few in the first world know being near drowning in this analogy). Whatever existential philosophy there is wont justify how many people live lives where they do nothing but starve to death. The world isn't a story, everyone just crawls around like ants until we die. Even in less fanciful stories like ASOIAF at least there's a point, and there is some plot armor, but nothing's preventing a baby from being kidnapped later in life, eventually forgetting who she is year 16 in some strangers basement while having rape baby #6 punched out of her. 

Decay and negativity is the default state of everything. All things just erode away, everything is fated to end in destruction. It's ingrained into the universe and human brain. 

I was sheltered in the top deck of the ship, but now the ceiling of my room is leaking, and I'm reminded of the nature of everything. 

It's best I don't have any more attachments, no investments in a world so capricious and uncaring. 

Shit can still happen to me. But nothing so terrible as an abducted child, a career worked so hard for going down the tubes, getting cuckolded, or losing the best cat in the world when he was so young, can happen to me.

I should just find a stable job that'll get me enough to go on, a small cheap apartment that I'm not at risk of not being able to afford, and just stick to my vidya. Or I should kill myself. Anything to get out of/escape this fundamentally tainted reality. 


You can post your stories about how life once sucked for you but now you're happy as a clam. You just lucked out, doesn't mean life is actually worth it. Doesn't matter how touched you were when your kid was born, women are being circumcised right now and they were when your kid was being born. 


You can say I'll grow out of this thinking, you may be right, doesn't mean I'm wrong.

"Referencing to this article, he had two miscarriages with his wife, Samantha, before having two more children with the same defects he and his wife shares.

Hello CMV, practicing Christian here! 

I believe that far too many people (this will be reddit-centric) hold many ideas about the bible that reveal only a cursory (and often secondhand) idea about the bible. This post is largely in response to this(https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3fsgbp/cmvbelief_in_christianity_does_not_necessitate/) one, which harbors several critical arguments including:

1. Homosexuality is sinful as stated in the Bible

and 

2. Christians who eat shellfish and wear mixed fibers are just as guilty of sin as homosexuals.

Now, both of these views do not take into account the historical context in which they are presented in the Bible. I will start with point 2 because it leads into point 1.   

Many people argue point two is ridiculous. Anti-theists use it point out the absurdity of the Bible, whereas (Liberal) Theists use it to point out the absurdity of Homosexuality being sinful. What this point fails to address, though, is the difference between Moral and Ceremonial Law. From the website: ""The ceremonial laws are called hukkim or chuqqah in Hebrew, which literally means 'custom of the nation'; the words are often translated as 'statutes.'"" Rules such as not eating shellfish and wearing mixed fibers falls into this section. Now, main reason why people single out homosexuality is because Paul lists it as a sexual sin in the New Testament, and is among many of the other ""big sins"" often enumerated in the Bible, including killing, stealing, and lying. 

On point 1, the question becomes why the compilers of the bible centuries ago felt compelled to add passages calling out monogamous same-sex relationships. Unless, of course, it doesn't.(https://moanti.wordpress.com/2010/08/02/gaychristians/) The crux of the matter is that homosexual sex was used during antiquity as a means of humiliating and demeaning foreigners ( as explained further in this link(https://moanti.wordpress.com/2013/07/07/the_bible_verse_most_christians_dont_like_to_quote/) ), and was therefore an act of Rape, distinct from the 21st century idea that two homosexuals can have a loving and fulfilling relationship.  

I implore the on-the-fence theists reading this to examine the links provided as I also implore the atheists reading to use these links to please call out any of my so-called brothers and sisters who use the Bible as a tool for hate and power.

Thanks for reading.  

Edit: I just wanted to clarify that I am arguing specifically about homosexuality as it is understood in society and in light if biblical interpretation.

Also, I am by not by any stretch of the imagination a biblical scholar, pastor, or the like, so be gentle please :)

"For the record, I am not a fan at all of how the second half of the Deathly Hallows went, but I want to focus on Harry's ""death"". I think he should have remained dead. 

I thought it was really beautifully done. He was surrounded by the spirits of those who loved him. Harry was giving himself to rescue his friends. The readers were properly prepared for it. It was a great emotional experience. 

Then it became stupid. By a complete deus ex machina, Harry Potter was allowed to come back to life because ""Voldemort only killed part of his own soul"". I have had this argument with a lot of people, but I seem to be alone in this opinion. Having Harry come back for essentially no reason cheapens and trivializes that great experience the readers had.

Think of the awesome emotional and important parts of the series. How many people think of Harry's ""death""? I know I don't. Cause it didn't mean anything. If he had stayed dead, it would have been one of the most famous tragic moments in all of literature, given how widely read and loved Harry Potter is. 

I'm not sure how exactly it would end after that. My favorite way would be for Voldemort to be killed by all of Harry's friends who he has trained. Or even by the combined love of Hermione and Ron because the love theme is so strong in Harry Potter. Voldemort would still destroy the Harry horcrux when Harry died. It could end different ways, but the main point is that I think it would have been a great, if sad and tragic, moment if Harry died.","{'he', 'his', 'himself'}"
"I shall start with an axiom, i thing what really makes the biggest difference between humans is : Physical attractiveness, money/social statuts, personal characteristics (the third is very tricky because sometimes it's interconnected with the two first : Example an intelliget person may make more money, attractive people are judged more intelligent. I think physical attractiveness is the most important but this is a personnal opinion that i won't add to the axiom).

So, IF WE accept that axiom, won't the fact of making everybody equal on economical grounds (even if it was a realistic goal, free of any abuses of those power), gives the attractive a very big edge ? Bigger than what they have now.

At least now, a man can compete against a more attractive peer in some circonstances by making more money, having a better status. That possibility would be gone in a perfect communist system. At least there is a chance of making money, it can be a really remote chance depending on the circonstances, but it's possible. Becoming attractive in the other hand.

The only way to make communism more egalitarian is to tax people more for physical attractiveness.

If you don't accept the axiom, you can also try to change my view.

"So I came out recently and well I am finding out how much homophobia still exists in my little corner of England.

"Okay, this is a tough, long one to write out and explain, but I'll do my best. Currently I am actually having trouble understanding why these crimes are inherently wrong, other than that if they were not thought of as terrible, all hell would break loose and there would be no order. I am honestly open to changing my view (I even desire to change it, as I think I'm becoming extremely cynical). For some background I am in a graduate program in neuroscience. 

Moving on...I am sure someone might say ""well how would you like it if you/your family were raped/murdered"", but I feel that kind of reinforces my point - this reason just shows we are afraid of backlash, and thus order in society is necessary. 

--- First of all, despite what we pretend to be, I honestly believe humans are actually very primitive. This means they are violent, still think with their ""reptilian brains"", and except outliers, are trying to fulfill their evolutionary/biological purpose - to create offspring.  Examples of what I see as proof for the primitive claim: 

a) Perhaps some will point to the vast increases in science in technology as evidence that we are in fact not primitive, but 99.9999% of those increases come from 0.00001% of the population. Does the average human (on a global scale) really have anything to do with sending a man up to the moon or discovering a cure for a disease?

b) Incredible amount of violence. The Holocaust was not too long ago...hundreds of thousands of soldiers/civilian supporters/etc all advocating for and carrying out genocide that killed millions. And that is just one example (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_genocides_by_death_toll). I don't believe that a handful of ""evil"" people could have carried these out - instead they were carried out by a group, albeit smaller, like 10% or so, and supported by something like 40%, and shown indifference by the majority of the rest. Again, need I mention ISIS, American acts against Natives, African tribe warfare, the list goes on. I believe every single human (yes you behind the computer screen) is capable of shocking violence or brutality. Our capacity and frequency of violence shows we are primitive.

c) Factors in sexual attraction. This is a big one, because almost every single human is ""guilty"" of it. Both men and women will say they are looking for someone who is ""kind, intelligent, etc"", but much research has shown the most attractive trait women look for is height. The biggest reason for this is evolution - a bigger hunter/gatherer, protector, even dominator of women. Do women in cushy Western society today really need a big guy to protect them...I don't think so. For men, it is a combination of fertility signs (e.g. hip ratio) and youth. Again, personality goes out the window when you are looking at a woman with a beautiful figure. If you think about it, the sexual preferences of a human today (height, strength, resources for women...or beauty, fertility for men) are honestly closer to the sexual preferences of our closest relative, the chimpanzee, than to some mythical advanced human civilization that places the utmost value on compassion, intelligence, etc. Again, to me this shows that we are quite primitive.

d) There is a similar primitive basis in other human ideas, like blind patriotism, or even racism in all aspects of society, from dating to careers (similar to animosity between tribes of chimpanzees, and attempts to maintain social hierarchy within tribes). Another one is harmful religious beliefs and traditions held by majority of humanity (showing a lack of understanding for science, progress). Not to bring another argument into this debate, but a good example is circumcision - 60% of male babies in the USA will be circumcised (99% for non-medical reasons), and 100-200 will die from complications, although thankfully there are a few societies, like Germany, where this is illegal, it still shows you how primitive we really are. Same thing (worse health effects for most types) on the other side of the planet with FGM. 

---- Thus, I think we've fooled ourselves into thinking we have become so advanced (morally, scientifically) as a species and civilization. In fact, we are extremely primitive, and I think the outrage and shock that we feel when we hear of a rape or murder victim (or any other serious crime) is honestly just a farce. Of course I don't mean to say that people who feel sad and angry are lying, but I mean that our empathy here stems from societal teachings. 

Given what we are capable of, given our track record in history, is it really so surprising if a man rapes a woman? After all, if we are this primitive, we are all just trying to spread our genes, create offspring, survive, reproduce, and so on.

Example - I might say: Isn't it wrong that a compassionate, intelligent person will not reproduce if he/she does not meet the primitive biological preferences of humans today? Well, you would say: It might be wrong, but it's just because of the sexual preferences (read: primitive nature) of humanity. In the same way, you might say: Isn't it terribly wrong if a person rapes another, steals all their money, kills their enemies and competition? I might say: It might be wrong, but it's just because of the primitive nature of humanity. 

---

In summary: humans are actually very primitive, as is evident by their violence, sexual preferences, racism, and harmful religious practices. Murder, rape, theft is to be expected in such a primitive species. We overreact to these crimes because it disrupts the order of society, not because they are inherently immoral.

Anyway, please CMV! By the way, I talked about murder/rape because it is easy to feel empathy for the victims, but this extends to all other crimes. Also, no religious arguments please.

"With responsibility, comes authority.  Cases such as this one(https://www.thefire.org/sexual-assault-injustice-at-occidental-college-railroads-accused-student/) at Occidental College.  There are other example cases as well, but this one is relatively 'clean' in that there was considerable documentation/evidence that both parties consented (and both parties had been drinking).  The man was expelled from school, the woman was not.


With this as a cautionary-tale/backdrop to the male decision making process, I come up with the following logic being the only reasonable interpretation for men to consider in terms of governing sexual relationships with women in college.


1) If the woman says no, it means no, obviously.


2) If the woman says yes but has had a drink, it's up to the man to determine if she still has the authority to consent, the safe answer being 'no, she does not.'


3) If the woman says yes and has had no alcohol, it is up to the man to determine if she has the emotional maturity to consent at all (e.g., will she regret it).



So, she can certainly say no, but only a man can determine if she has the right or agency to say yes, and women are under no reciprocal obligation.


This doesn't feel like a very positive outcome for women, I feel it robs them of control over their bodies.  It would also seem to rob a happy couple of the simple pleasure of an evening at home drinking with some sex before bed.  However I am unable to arrive at another intepretation or approach that mitigates the risk to men given the current Title IX interpretation.

"Some Definitions

Islamism - Political Movements that use Islam to justify either their end goals (ie. a religious state, or ""caliphate"") or the means they use (ie. violence, terrorism).

Islam - Religion with 1 billion followers worldwide. Draws doctrine from the Qu'ran (a holy book) and the Hadith (the biography of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)). 

Sheik - An educated religious leader that are theological scholars, and have power to issue religious opinions/rulings, known as fatwas.



My case is this.

 Fighting Islamic Terrorism through military force DOES NOT WORK.
The emergence of ISIS/ISIL/Daesh is strong evidence that foreign invasions cannot create stability in a country.

 A key feature of Islamic Terrorism is theological ignorance.
Islam only permits violence in certain circumstances, which are fairly well established. This mirrors a general ignorance among Muslims of what Islam is. This is compounded by the fact that Sheiks pass on their knowledge to students via a mentoring process. Lines of Sheiks are dying out due to a lack of willing students, and knowledge is being lost with them. The pull of Islamism on young men may be contributing to this.

 A greater understanding of Islam is incompatible with Islamism - The Qu'ran is a suprisingly thought-provoking text, even for the secular reader. It constantly promotes critical thinking, and warns against interpreting its verses in a dogmatic way. A study of the life of the Prophet (pbuh), where he only fought as a last resort and was firmly against the killing of non-combatants, is totally at odds with Islamists. The fact that modern Islamist organisations (eg. Al-Quaeda, ISIL) are theologically innovative (rather than trying to get back to 7th Century Islam) is something that Al-Quaeda openly admits and is one of their most obvious flaws to Muslim observers.

My solution is that the West, with its traditions of academic study and economic power at the greatest they have ever been, should help educate Muslim countries about their own religion. Education should be at the grass roots level, the theological, and academic levels. I think there is a rather poetic justification in that the Islamic Empire safeguarded many of the texts of Europe and the Greeks at the time Europe was going through its Dark Ages. A similar thing could be argued to be taking place in the Muslim World today. 

TL;DR - I think it would be more effective, more sustainable, and it would diffuse the antipathy towards Islam in the Western World.

"This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in.  I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this belief is rather ingrained.  

My wife and I are both children of Poor Asian immigrants to this country.  I will reflect on my mother’s story.  She had me very young out of wedlock with no support from my biological father while her parents were stuck in our native country.  When she came to this country she was on government assistance.  With very little support she was able to finish community college, transfer to a four year college majoring in computer science eventually getting a Master’s Degree.  Her story is not unique to the rest of my relatives or the Asian immigrant community.  I don’t need to discuss how my wife and I are doing since we have greatly benefited from our parent’s generation, their hard work and sacrifice.  

I hear the arguments regarding systemic discrimination of blacks in this country.  I’ve read Unequal Childhoods by Annette Laureau regarding kids in disadvantaged environments are less likely to succeed than those in middle to upper class upbringings.  However I don’t completely buy into it.  I’ve seen countless family members and friends go from food stamps to sedans in the burbs, and I attribute that to a culture centered around hard work, sacrifice, and education.  As my mom was going through school, we lived in poorer neighborhoods, and I was raised in neighborhoods with Blacks and Hispanics, sure I’ll throw out the I had black friends card, I still do.   At the time we were on the same level economically, yet culturally we were worlds apart in what was emphasized from a parenting standpoint.  As I grew up I met more successful black kids in undergrad, grad school, work, but most of them came up from middle class upbringings.  They had no problems acting 'white' while I saw my childhood poor black friends get mocked for doing so, therefore I believe its a cultural part of poor black americans which is hindering them from assimilating into middle class america.  That is why I don’t have compassion for the narrative that is pushed in the media for the poor black or hispanic american unable to rise from poverty.  I know this is a strong talking point for the right wing yet I have not read any tangible counter argument to the dispute the Poor Asian immigrant story.  If there are books or articles which provides a cogent counter argument please feel free to share.    

TL:DR – The rationale for why blacks and Hispanics are unsuccessful in the U.S. are bunk because of the success of Asian Immigrants.  

Edit: This is not to say that there isn't racism in society, especially towards Asians.  Colleges definitely try to make it harder for Asians to get admitted despite higher scores, and there is a Bamboo Ceiling in the workplace.  However, I don't believe racism is so pervasive in this country that it can hold an entire demographic in poverty against their will, I believe this is attributed to culture.  

Edit2: I appreciate the dialogue.  One point which I'll concede and am swayed from the dialogue is that racism, more specifically the historic racism perpetrated in the U.S. such as Jim Crow and Slavery created the culture which is present in the poor black community, hindering them from rising from poverty.  But nothing disputes that this culture is reason, and not the present-day racism that is preventing them from achieving in this country.  That is what I have issue against that the media portrays a image of victimization due to current day racism, however, I don't think the type of racism is the cause, maybe past racism, but not the type minorities face today.  If no one has a counter argument against the cultural aspect, shouldn't black culture, the one that glamorizes the baller lifestyle, be the focused of policy makers to change rather than focusing their efforts on social restructuring to accomodate the culture?  

Edit3: At the end of the day, and the dialogue set forth I come away from it with the following:

1) That current poor black culture  is a result of systemic discrimination.  
2) No one has disputed that culture which I have generally claimed is the REASON for the state of poor black americans.  
3) The present day racism and white privilege that exists today is not sufficient enough to either hold a demographic down or lift them up, not as much as the modern day media seem to claim.   
4) I want to beef up on some books and articles cited
5) The IQ debate. hmmm I'm just not going to touch that right now.

"So watching John Oliver last night, 

(yes Last Week Tonight is not a source of news - I haven't researched this further and in case some facts are off, treat this is more of a hypothetical)

a politician basically delayed DC's clean injection site for some number of years, with thousands of people getting HIV per year. Once that politician ceased blocking it (while the whole time he had solid data of its effectiveness based on it being implemented in his own state!) the HIV infection rates went down by 80% or whatever, of course. So, because of his blocking the safe injection site, thousands of people got HIV and many probably died.

I think he is responsible for those deaths, to some degree, and should face some sort of consequences. I am not sure what they would be, or what the crime would even be (if an appropriate one exists (yet)), but he was surely negligent, deliberately acting against this proven life saving thing.

This obviously reaches toward some greater point about how responsible politicians are for the harm they cause, and a precedent here would have far reaching conclusions. For example, a politician who broadcasts to 300 million people that homeless people are merely lazy, will convince millions of people of that and cause poorer treatment of homeless people, which will lead to deaths in some threshold cases - how responsible is that politician for those deaths he clearly indirectly caused? 

I'm not sure what the right path is, but surely there is something more just than ""those people made their own free will choices, not his fault"" and ""well, just don't vote for him next time.""","{'he', 'him', 'his'}"

The Confederacy was racist according to the cornerstone speech and secession papers (tx):
Cornerstone Speech excerpt t:

 Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition

Texas secession papers excerpt(https://www.tsl.texas.gov/ref/abouttx/secession/2feb1861.html):

 She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery--the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits--a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time.

If the new government the Confederacy was trying to replace the current one with was based on that Cornerstone, there is no denying the Confederacy was racist. Those that fought for the cause of the Confederacy and helped further it, helped further ""the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition"" are culpable.

Point 1: Someone who fights for a racist cause, helps create an institution to power that racism, and otherwise spread it is racist. People who have done this don't deserve to be monumented, or at the very least don't deserve to be monumented something as defining as a town square.

Point 2: A monument with the words ""Our Confederate Soldiers"" cannot monument just the soldiers without endorsing their actions to some extent.

Point 3: The image of a Confederate soldier being a defining landmark in the center of a city is an endorsement of the Confederacies actions and perpetuates racism by virtue of it being a defining part of the cityscape.

"See update at the bottom

Yesterday I suggested that men and women could compete fairly against each other in sports, if we split up competitors into the proper classes for the sport. In other words, instead of gender segregation - men's tennis vs. women's tennis, we would have multiple classes of tennis, based on physical attributes. The goal would be to pick classes in a way that gender doesn't matter, so everyone in class X has the same raw physical potential.

For some sports like boxing the classes would probably be the familiar weight classes: heavyweight, featherweight, etc. But I'm definitely not saying that those classes are the final word, and for other sports I'm not sure what the class criterion would be. Some possibilities include height, weight, % of muscle mass, % of different types of muscle, lung efficiency, and so forth. The criteria for classes would be chosen by experts in the field based on objective criteria.

When I suggested this, I was basically downvoted into oblivion, told that this idea would destroy women's sports, that men are obviously superior to women so my idea doesn't even make sense, and mostly just told ""but men will still beat women"" many times.

Now, of course, in the top weight classes in boxing men would dominate, simply because most people over a certain mass of muscle are male. But that's the point of having non-heavyweight classes in boxing - the other classes let other people compete fairly too.

And likewise, in basketball, height is a huge advantage, and there are far far more men in the extreme high end of height, that I don't expect to see women there. But I would expect to see women in a height class of basketball which is low enough so that there are far more women than men (talking about adults here), and even more so if we also took into account % of muscle mass.

I was told that Serena Williams, the top female tennis player in the world, lost to the 200th top male tennis player, and  I guess people infer from that that women are simply inferior to men physically. To which I ask: Are they inferior, if you control for % of muscle mass, weight, and other relevant factors to the sport?

I don't see why women would be inferior in such conditions. Yes, women have less size and % of muscle mass than men, on average, but for two human beings with the same height/weight/muscle mass/etc. (whatever makes sense for the specific sport), but one is a man and the other is a woman, surely the competition would be quite fair?

As far as I can tell, there is no ""magic"" difference between male and female athletes. There is no ""male muscle"" or ""female muscle"", it is just that men tend to have more of it.

The only potentially valid argument I heard against my idea was the claim that men have so many advantages - from big ones like amount of muscle, to small ones like shape of their hip bones - that if sports created categories based on them all, it would end up with men in one and women in the other, reproducing the current gender segregation, and that if that isn't taken to that extreme, then women will basically vanish from sports. I concede that is theoretically possible, and it would be hard for me to disprove it, but it goes entirely against my intuition on this.

edit: It will NOT change my opinion if you say ""but the best female athletes can't compete against much more mediocre male athletes"". My proposal's entire point is to address that by defining classes in which to compete, defined physically and objectively. People would compete against their physical equals. So by definition, if it wouldn't be a fair fight for those women, they would not be in the same class. See the ""if"" in the very first paragraph.

UPDATE: Thanks to everyone for all the discussion so far. At this point I'd like to summarize things up to this point, because it seems like 100 people are making quite similar arguments, and I don't have enough time to answer every person. I apologize for comments that I don't get the chance to respond to.

  Many people say that women are just not good enough. Most people support that with anecdotes like this women's team lost to a team of teenage boys. I am not saying there is no value to such anecdotes, but:
   There are anecdotes going the other way, like Serena and Venus losing but not losing by that much to the 200th top male player. If Serena and Venus can beat everyone but the top 500 or so tennis players in the whole world, then they are doing amazingly well. If we split people also by some physical factors (response time? % of muscles? % of fast-twitch muscle fibers?), I don't see why they can't win in their own class, and the few hundred or so men that can beat them would be in the other class.
   Even if most professional women's teams currently lose to more mediocre men, we don't know how much of that is physically based. Part of it, as posters correctly brought up - this was a point I didn't realize before - was that women compete against other women, so they aren't getting challenged enough. For example, if Serena and Venus practiced heavily against male players, maybe they would have beat that 200th guy. And the best way to change this is to open up more cross-gender competition.
    To further see the importance of competition, look at this article about the gender gap in sports
  Other people say that women are just not good enough based on scientific data. This could convince me, but so far I don't see enough. For example, yes, women have less muscle mass on average, but AFAIK the science shows that the muscle they do have is equivalent to male muscle. So if we control for the amount (and %) of muscle, it should be fair, in sports where raw muscle is the crucial thing. But, if you find data showing that 99% of men have better coordination than the top 1% of women, I might be convinced on this. The criteria for my being convinced is, as I wrote in my last paragraph: If, to make the competition fair, we need to control for more and more physical factors, until the categories end up having all women in one and all men in the other (or 99.99% of all), then I am just recreating the current system, but with added costs but no benefit.
   Also, don't forget that we can create classes based on various factors, like a basketball team of people of height 1.60m. Since very few adult men exist of that height, I assume it would be dominated by women. So even if in a no-restrictions competition men would always win, if we limit by physical criteria, women can win in some classes. You can convince me I am wrong if you can show that even in a category like basketball 1.60m, that despite there being far, far more candidate women, men would still dominate it, and would do so even if we control for say % of muscle mass.
    And if you think 1.60m basketball sounds odd, I would say it is no more odd than lightweight boxing. It's actually a somewhat different sport, and interesting in a different way. I personally would be fascinated to see, just for variety, basketball played not by super-tall people.
  Some people said that even if we find a way to split into physically-based classes, women would dominate the ""lesser"" ones. I do concede that more money goes into heavyweight boxing than lightweight. But, that is also already the case today with women's sports (compare the WNBA to the NBA), but those classes do well enough. I think my proposal could actually help, because I think making the classes more objective and having mixed-gender competitions would be novel and interesting.
  Overall, I think a common thing happening in this discussion is that it seems obvious to most of you that women are just never going to be good enough, and I am asking for more concrete evidence for something which you take almost for granted. Of course, I agree it is hard to estimate how my proposal will work, especially when each sport would have its own criteria for classes, but I still think there is plenty of reason for optimism. So far my optimism has not been proven unjustified, as far as I can tell.

"Gaston, the loud and boisterous dreamboat is known as the main Antagonist of Disney's Beauty and the Beast, and is arguably one of the most known Disney villains of all time, fighting and womanizing his way through the small French village before ultimately meeting a brutal end by falling to his death off of Beast's Castle and impaling himself on a spiked fence.  While Gaston is written to be the evil character in this film, I believe that it is unfair to put him in this light, and if anything, he's a good guy.  Here is my reasoning

1.  Overwhelmingly, the villagers seem to absolutely adore Gaston, and not because of some shady shit where he's hiding who he truly is.  Everybody knows the true Gaston and yet they loyally follow him anyway, even into battle. I refuse to believe that this is because the village is populated entirely by villains, and instead it must mean that Gaston truly has a way of winning over people.

2.  People often say that the way that he approached Belle in asking her to marry him was rude and misogynistic.  While I don't necessarily believe that any of these traits make a villain, I still think that it is unfair to paint him with any of these labels.  He approached her with great confidence, a trait that just about every woman likes in a man, and his track record of having every woman in the village swoon over him means that it's really not his fault that he expected Belle to be different. The fact that he even asked Belle herself as opposed to demanding her from her father shows that he probably really did care about her, especially since he probably could have done the former given the time period the movie is set in.  

3.  The act that truly cements Gaston as the ""villain"" of the story is when (in what I think is the movie's best song), he rallies the entire town to go kill the beast, now at this point in the story, the beast had attacked and kidnapped Belle's father, and he also held Belle hostage during which he verbally abused her, kept her locked in her room, and even came close to physically assaulting her.  While the beast had gone through some personal growth during this period, Gaston had no way of knowing this, and none of that excuses the fact that he fucking kidnapped Belle.  So, disregarding his own personal safety, and acting out of anger for what has happened to Belle even though she brutally rejected and insulted him (a very selfless act if you ask me),  Gaston charges headlong into a castle to destroy this beast that he logically believes is a violent and dangerous creature, and then the story ends.  

Overwhelmingly, I see nothing that shows Gaston to be  the evil sociopathic villain that Disney wants to portray him as.  In fact, I see him as a lovestruck and rightfully angered man, albeit a little bit egotistical, but hey, plenty of us are.

"First of all, the law I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general.

Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. The rules don't tell you to give up your seat for her, but you do.

This short scenario illustrates that rules and morals are two different things. However, I see more and more people defending actions saying it was ""legal"", and therefore it should be alright. 

The death of Cecil the lion is an (extreme) example: the man who shot him defended himself by declaring that what he did was legal. As the global outrage over his actions showed us, it was however completely immoral.

Another example: bankers. I read in a book that bankers that are considered ""professional"" disregard their own morals as much as possible and instead try to do as much as is legally possible. Immoral bankers and brokers are a core part of why the 2008 crisis was able to happen.

I think this illustrates what happens when people use the law as ""moral compass"": immoral behavior. 

Secondly, I think this is caused by the fact that our law is not our morals themselves but rather these morals applied into (simplified) rules.

Thirdly, I think it's impossible to enforce socially appropriate behavior like giving up your bus seat. This follows from my second viewpoint: because rules are simplified results of our morals, they can never cover every aspect of our lives, therefore leaving gaps for bus travellers and dentists and bankers to exploit.

I think it's up to us to be aware of this and never use the law as a moral compass. Please, change my view.

"I don't see a lot of discussion of the Iran deal on Reddit, which is surprising to me since I think there's a good chance it will wind up as the most significant foreign policy development of the Obama presidency.


Before I launch into my discussion of this issue, let me state the assumptions I'm making about how we evaluate America's national security interests:


1. The top strategic priority for the U.S. is to minimize the chance of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon.  This would be considered the ""worst case scenario"" for the U.S. and its Western allies.

2. The U.S.'s second strategic priority is to minimize the chance of the U.S. entering another ground war in the Middle East (i.e. the ""invade Iran"" outcome).

3. The U.S.'s third strategic priority is to minimize Iran's capacity to support terrorist organizations (i.e. Hezbollah, Hamas) and engage in ""proxy wars"" with our allies (basically Israel and Saudi Arabia), as well as to push Iran to improve the human rights situation within its own borders.


My understanding is further that these priorities are strictly ordered, i.e. that 1  2  3 in importance, and that (for example) we would only want a better outcome in #3 if it did not come at the expense of #1 and #2.  If you disagree with the assumptions I'm making here, I'm willing to discuss them further in the comments.  But I feel pretty comfortable making these assumptions because pretty much everything I've read (both from the left and from the right, both in favor of and against the deal) has made more or less the same ones.


With that out of the way, let's consider the possibilities on the table.


As I see it, when you push past the rhetoric and boil down what proponents and critics of the deal are saying, there are basically only four options:

A. Approve the deal.

B. Reject the deal with the intention of returning to the negotiating table for ""a better deal.""

C. The military option-- invade Iran for the strategic purpose of destroying their nuclear program.

D. Do nothing (don't approve any deal and continue with the status quo).


Almost everyone seems clear that C is a terrible option.  As we saw in Iraq, our ability to achieve strategic goals through military force in the Middle East is limited.  We would be committing perhaps another trillion dollars or more, to say nothing of the massive loss of American and Iranian life (probably on a scale far greater than we saw in the Iraq war, due to the more advanced nature of Iran’s military infrastructure), and the end result would be further destabilization of the region and more breeding grounds for terrorist groups akin to ISIS.  Some have suggested an air-war only approach, but this would not guarantee eradication of the nuclear program because of sites like Fordow, which houses a nuclear facility deep in an underground bunker.  Michael Hayden, who had been CIA director under George W. Bush, also makes a credible argument that an invasion would actually cause the creation of a nuclear weapon, since they would then pull out all the stops on producing one and we wouldn’t be able to destroy their infrastructure in time.


So the military option is awful.  But in my reading, Option D (do nothing) is almost as bad.  If we do nothing, then there are no restrictions and no oversight on Iran's nuclear program from the West whatsoever.  There would be nothing to stop them from developing a nuclear weapon in as few as a few months.  Israel would likely invade Iran before they let that happen, potentially drawing the U.S. into a Middle East war anyway.  So the status quo is pretty untenable.  Even opponents of the deal tend to concede this.


That brings us to Option B, which seems to be the main conservative alternative to the deal.  The idea here is that we should leave sanctions in place, or even toughen them up, until Iran is forced to agree to a much more one-sided capitulation. 


This sounds good in theory, but there are several reasons to think this is just unrealistic:

 Russia and China are desperate to resume trade with Iran.  Whether we approve the deal or not, they are likely to repeal their own sanctions (frankly, it was amazing that Obama even got them to go along with the sanctions in the first place.)  Therefore, even if Congress passes tougher sanctions, overall economic pressure on the country will decrease, not increase, weakening our negotiating position.
 The EU and our other non-Israel allies will blame the U.S., rather than Iran, for the deal falling through, and may even act to decrease their own sanctions.
 Iran has to appease its own hardliners in government.  The Supreme Leader would not consent to any deal that didn’t include some sort of “face-saving” provision, that lets them propagandize to their own people about their victory over the West.  Therefore, the chance of any deal passing that eliminates 100% of their centrifuges (a key demand of the American right) seems impossible.


The point has been made that Option B is basically the best-case scenario for the Iranian government.  If the deal falls through, then they get relief from the economic sanctions that have crippled their country (regardless of what Congress does), they are left with zero international oversight over their nuclear program and are thus free to chug ahead, and best of all, the Americans take the blame for the whole thing on the world stage.


Advocates of Option B point out that if we grant Iran any form of sanctions relief, it is likely that they will spend at least some of the money financing terrorist organizations.  As far as I can see, this is probably true  (Iran no longer funds Hamas.   But I also don’t really see any way to avoid this without compromising Priority #1 or Priority #2, or more likely, both.  


Approving the deal at least gets us oversight, in the form of IAEA inspections, which will have the right to go to any suspicious facility at any time for any reason.  Experts estimate that Iran would not have enough uranium to produce a bomb in less than a year.  If they attempt to ""cheat"" or deny access to inspectors, the ""snapback"" provisions will mean a return to crippling sanctions (and Russia and China won't be able to veto them.)  It's not a perfect deal, but as far as I can see it does achieve Priority #1 and #2 for the U.S.'s national security interests better than any other present option.


If George W. Bush had developed a more coherent Iran strategy beyond just “let’s have some sanctions and eventually they will capitulate to our every demand somehow,” we would probably be in a much better negotiating position (and Iran would be much less far along in its nuclear development.)  He also pretty much destroyed the credibility of any military threat by demonstrating just how unable we are to advance our strategic interests through war in the Middle East.  But given the situation as it stands, I just don’t see any reasonable alternative to approving the (admittedly imperfect) Iran deal.  CMV.

"Recently there has been some discussion about the exact limits of consent where it regards sex, and I am somewhat skeptical about consent having to also be ""enthusiastic"".

Now I could be interpreting it wrong in this context, but that seems like it could lead to some weird situations.

For example, say a guy wants to have sex with his GF, so he asks her. But she isn't that horny, she just wants to watch Game of Thrones. 

Obviously if she shoots him down then that is that. But what if she says something like ""Whatever. I just want to watch Game of Thrones, so as long as you don't block the screen do as you like.""

Does going ahead make him a rapist or guilty of sexual assault simply because she wasn't enthusiastic enough? I honestly don't think so.

How often does that happen? No idea. But given how many people have sex and how fucking good Game of Thrones is I bet it has happened once.

Am I saying it is a good idea? No. Do I acknowledge that sometimes a ""yes"" can be forced? Of course. But requiring ""enthusiastic"" consent just paints with an overly broad brush imho. Maybe say ""not pressured"" or something else instead.

"Think about it this way: would you approve of federal funding to support a special task force of batmen in every major city in America? The batmen are well paid and highly armed with military grade technology. They can use theatrics to scare people. They operate outside the law, do not require evidence or due process of any kind, and suffer no penalty for excessive use of violence. The argument in favor of this is that the batmen can better intimidate, scare and ultimately beat up low level criminals, which will reduce crime.

This solution assumes that a) crime is a major problem, b) only bad people commit crime and c) they will only stop committing crime through the threat of violence. It does nothing to address issues of poverty, inequality, domestic violence, mental illness or any of the myriad of other social issues that lead to crime. Having batmen patrol the streets of any city is an absurd extension of a modern police state.

I think this is really what the story of Batman is though. It romanticizes a lone vigilante who carries military grade weapons, uses theatrics to scare people, operates outside the law and suffers no penalty for excessive use of violence, which he frequently resorts to. He is trust-fund baby who is motivated by childhood trauma which he has failed to deal with in any sort of mature way.

On the contrary, violence against children has proven to be one of the most enduringly successful tactics; as heinous as it is in the microcosm, in the macrocosm it yields very successful results for a noble cause. One can see this in the Old Testament, where the Israelites showed no compunctions towards killing small children and were rewarded with a defensible state, and in modern times the success of the State of Israel as well. You see the same in ISIS; they show depraved indifference towards civilian life and as a result their enemies shut down because their lizard brain cannot condemn a baby-killer. If those who fight against imperialists (in the US, Europe, Canada, Ukraine -- both sides are imperialist scum -- etc) used the same tactic, the global system would not see the threat they faced until it was too late.

"Arguments against sex work, primarily but not limited to prostitution, often include but are not limited to;

1) It is frequently used to exploit a societal underclass

2) Training for these activities often begins with the exploitation of children

3) It frequently leads to adverse long-term health effects, including high rates of drug addiction

4) Enables rich individuals with significant networks (often illegal) to control peoples' lives

5) People engaged in these activities are often forcibly relocated

6) It is ""indecent""

I believe all arguments, except number 6, also apply to professional athletics. Why can a man, or even worse, a child, elect to become a football player and absolutely destroy his body (The average football player dies in his fifties(https://www.boston.com/lifestyle/health/2013/01/29/nfl-players-union-and-harvard-team-landmark-study-football-injuries-and-illness/aCGnf96h7ptWX2Lnp5MIiP/story.html)) but a woman cannot elect to be paid for sex? They are both professions that use and arguably abuse their bodies. The majority of individuals engaged in both fields often engage in related, self-destructive and/or illegal activities. Having one not only legal but celebrated and the other shunned and rendered illegal is hypocritical.

"I understand lions are endangered animals and that these people were poaching illegally which was wrong. However I don’t think it’s fair to call them evil and treat them like monsters for killing lions.

Let me clear something up, I am not a vegetarian. I eat meat and don't feel sorry. Because of my contribution to the market animals have died. The average Joe is also a meat consumer. He’s okay with an industry of mass murder of animals so that he can enjoy their dead bodies with his evening meal. Why is that okay when someone killing for sport isn’t? Why is it okay for farmers to kill animals and sell their remains but not okay for the same thing to happen to lions?

The men who killed these lions did it illegally and deserve to be punished for that but I don't think they're evil murderers. I fail to see why lions are more important just because we see them as more beautiful or rare.

Lions are endangered animals and it’s a shame that two are now gone from the earth. These lions seemed to have been a big deal to their country which is sadder still but at the end of the day, they were killed for money just like farmers do hundreds of times a year.

These men are not monsters, calling them that is calling everyone who has ever killed or contributed to the killing (by for example eating) of animals.

Similar to the financial organization of the UN, all International Olympic Committee members should pay according to their ability. The Committee could invest in large stadiums that have an actual purpose after being used for the Olympic Games, namely, the next Olympic Games.

"Rock and Roll music is no longer an important part of the cultural conversation. This is obviously not to say that there is no longer rock music being made, that that music is never popular, or that that contemporary rock music isn't good. But rock has become similar to jazz and classical—while there is still lots of it being made, it's not a powerful cultural force any more. The modern cultural conversation is being played out in hip-hop and EDM.

Of the current Top 10 on the Billboard charts, the only rock single is ""Shut Up and Dance"" by Walk the Moon, at #9, and that song is heavily influenced by EDM. The current Song of the Summer is generally agreed to be Fetty Wap's ""Trap Queen."" The most consistently popular rock band currently is probably either the Foo Fighters, a band that has been around since the late 90s and still plays a very similar style of music to what they were playing then (and arguably still owe a large portion of their popularity to nostalgia for Nirvana, a band whose largest cultural moment was 24 years ago), or the Black Keys, a band playing with a deliberately retro style. 

Tame Impala and Arcade Fire, two bands that have been lauded for their innovation in the rock genre have on their most recent albums embraced EDM influences, and largely moved away from guitar-based rock. 

I would argue that the most culturally important albums of the past few months have been outside of rock—Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp A Butterfly, Drake's If You're Reading This It's Too Late, Mark Ronson's Uptown Special, Taylor Swift's 1989 (in which she ditched her country roots for an embrace of EDM pop).

There has been a lot of rock music recently that has been great too (Father John Misty, Courtney Barnett, Colleen Green, and Jim O'Rourke have all released albums I have absolutely loved, and I just listened to the new Titus Andronicus album yesterday) but that has become an exception, and as my examples point out, it's not really commercially popular or culturally relevant beyond a small core. 

I don't have a real problem with rock losing its cultural cachet. I love rap, R&amp;B, and electronica as well, and think that there is a lot of great innovation going on in modern music (and even that 2015 is an all-time stand-out year). But I think that rock has lost its importance in the wider culture, and that rock music is now even imbued with an inherent feeling of throwback, the way that jazz now makes people think of a certain time period even as jazz continues to innovate to this day.

"Necessary context: I am not old enough to have grown up with Mario Kart 64. The first console I ever owned (aside from my Game Boy Color) was a GameCube, and the first game I got for the system, aside from MVP Baseball '04, was Mario Kart: Double Dash. I've played the crap out of the GC, DS, Wii, and 3DS versions of the game, and have touched every other version to some extent (I own the GBA and N64 versions and play MK8 with my friend who owns a Wii U relatively often).

Hear me out on this one. I think Mario Kart 64 was the worst game in the series for a few reasons, some of which I'll outline here:

Course design. With a few exceptions (Choco Mountain and Yoshi Valley, for example), I think the courses in MK64 are the most boring courses in the Mario Kart Series by far, not counting SNES and GBA. And while it's easy to make the case that course design steadily improved with each game as more material became available and more memory was available to devote to each course, I think that the courses in MK64, SNES MK, and GBA MK were significantly, significantly worse than any of the other games' courses. The courses in these games are often flat and uninteresting, not particularly dynamic in terms of interesting turns or bits of track, and (especially with MK64) far too long. I think it's possible to have relatively gimmick-light courses which are still exceptionally fun (courses like the DS' DK Pass and the Gamecube's Dry Dry Desert did this very well), and I think that most of the N64's courses failed to accomplish this - they were largely dull, slow courses which were too large and monotonous to stand up very well. (And no, being able to skip half of Rainbow Road very much does not make that course any less of an absolute slog.) It has some of my least favorite courses in any Mario Kart game - Toad's Turnpike, Moo Moo Farm, and Rainbow Road are some of the worst MK courses I've played. I'm willing to give the SNES a pass for poor course design given exceedingly limited memory and the fact that it was one of the first games to really play with 3D in such a revolutionary way (as well as the fact that it, well, started the franchise, and therefore was allowed to have prototype bugs). I'm also willing to give the GBA version somewhat of a pass, given that it was the first mobile title and was on a tiny screen, though I also really don't like the course design there. But the N64 version? Not so much. The differences between the courses in the N64 and Gamecube games is so staggering that it's tough to give the former as much of a pass.

Graphics. Call me crazy, but I liked the SNES game's graphics a lot more than those of the N64's version. The N64 had some absolutely beautiful games for the time - Mario 64, Majora's Mask, and Banjo-Kazooie are all phenomenal-looking games. Compared to those, MK64 is flat-out ugly. The character models are very blocky and way too angular, the trails behind shells look gross, and the ""POOMP"" effects are really, for lack of a better term, ""immersion-breaking."" Especially compared to the very clean graphics of the previous console's incarnation (SNES) and the beautiful graphics of the next version (DD), MK64's graphics are particularly egregious.

Rubber-banding. It's bad in all Mario Kart games, but it's especially flagrant in MK64. In no other MK game I've played have I held a commanding lead and then literally seen second place teleport right behind me. They don't even do it the justice of speeding the player up - Wario or Peach or whoever will literally fade away and reform right behind me. I'm fine with rubber-banding (or more tolerant of, at least) as long as it's ""believable,"" and MK64's rubber-banding is one hundred percent not that.

As far as I can tell, the only thing MK64 really has going for it is its four-player multiplayer. This is huge, sure, but it would have probably come anyway - the SNES already had two-player multiplayer, and giving a game a pass just because four players can play it together doesn't mean all that much. Plus, I'd argue that pretty much every other game's multiplayer was better - what with online modes in almost every later incarnation and better balancing for all four players and some of the best battle modes we've seen yet in Double Dash and Funky Stadium in Wii, I'd argue that 64 was good multiplayer-wise but not good enough to elevate it above any of the other games (with the exception of the GBA edition, whose multiplayer was naturally near-impossible to implement).

So, CMV. I assume many of y'all feel pretty passionately about the quality of MK64, so this should shape up to be an interesting thread!

"I understand that this is a very controversial thing to say.  Perhaps my view comes from the women I am surrounded by, which is quite a small sample size. I look forward to hearing another point of view.

My main points:

1.) Physically.  Men dominate sports and physical events.  I can't think of one sport that women are better than men at, in general, and if there are a few, that's only a few, and men dominate the rest. 

2.) In the work place.  This is the most controversial part.  Women want equal pay, but from what I've seen in my limited 8 years in industry, is that women are not as good as men at their jobs.  My industry is oil refining.  99% of the plant workers are men, why?  I work in the Engineering office.  There are no women engineers, only secretaries, and some of them baffle me at how incompetent they are. (Admittedly our one secretary is excellent at her job, and does far better than I ever could.  But my point here is that a man could do that job just as well.) 

3.) At home.  This is where most of my point lies.  It could just be a gender roles thing, but why am I so much better at everything than my girlfriend?  I'm not saying I'm great, but rather most of the girlfriends I've had are completely incompetent at a lot of things.  Things like building an Ikea cabinet, she can't do it.  Small, mundane challenges like un-stacking and re-stacking a sleeve of solo cups.  We had to do it as part of a challenge, and I was much faster at it.  She couldn't figure out how the gear shifters worked on a newer mountain bike after riding it for 10 minutes.  I had never seen this type before, but figured it out in 10 seconds.  Not because I'm clever, but because it is simple and something I believe should be easy for any adult to figure out. 

These reasons are why I hold this view.  I look forward to being completely flamed for this view, and also for another perspective.  Thanks.

"I have several issues with it. But before i get into that, i will point out that i am perfectly fine with people hunting things to eat. Things like deer, and fowl.

But to go hunting for exotic animals is just selfish, cowardly, and just plain retarded to put it bluntly.

When people hunt exotic rare animals, like lions, rhinos, bears and girraffes to keep the head on their wall, they are taking what belongs to everyone, and basically stealing it. Everyone should be able to enjoy them in the wild, but with poaching threatening many species, there are fewer and fewer in the wild to see. 

Calling it a sport is a joke. Anybody with half a brain can go out and shoot an animal. They put them on their wall to tell everyone ""look at the dangerous animal i killed, pay no attention to my tiny penis"". All it shows it cowardice. You wanna make it a sport, hunt them with your hands and teeth, like they do. Animals like lions aren't afraid of humans, especially on the preserves. They don't run to hide, it's shooting fish in a barrel.

When an exotic animal needs to be culled, then let wardens do it, don't sell off the tag for someone for thousands of dollars so the can come and play king of the jungle.

"Working in family law, I meet a lot of men facing divorce who feel no obligation to support their ex.  You also hear a lot of mens rights activists bemoan the concept of alimony as unjust.  They usually cite statistics showing how often men are the ones disproportionately ordered to pay support.

I don't give much merit to these claims.  What most of these men don't understand is that marriage in the eyes of the law is primarily an economic partnership.  When a couple marries, they voluntarily agree to equally share resources produced during the marriage.  

The traditional view of marriage has the wife contribute via domestic labor, i.e. cooking, cleaning, childcare, etc.  First off, I think it is important to realize that this labor has real economic value.  These tasks need to be done in order for either spouse to succeed in another professional setting.  

The counter argument you often hear from divorced men is that their wives refused to work, and also refused to perform these domestic duties, and thus should not be entitled to support.  While this may not seem fair, the reality is that this outcome is still produced by the man's choice to marry someone with no professional prospects, and no willingness to perform domestic duties.  In other words, the man.entered into a bad economic partnership and must now shoulder the costs.

In many cases, whether the man realizes it or not, there was a reason why they chose to marry who they did.  Maybe it wasn't directly economic, maybe it was for sexual attraction, emotional support, or social status.  I would argue that even these factors have economic value, even if it is difficult to quantify.  When you develop a career, you pour your soul into your work, and everything about your lifestyle affects your success.  So regardless of whether the individual got what they thought they would from their spouse, their spouse still had an inexorable affect on their career and thus has earned a stake in it.  I think this is fundamentally fair, in my opinion.  

Finally, I want to point out that there is a distinction between temporary and permanent spousal support.  Temporary support is usually close to a 50%, flat calculation intended to maintain the parties lifestyle until permanent support is determined.  Permanent support is always a lower amount, intended to provide the supported party enough time to become self-sufficient through education, job training, etc.  In longer marriages, there might not be a termination date, for example if the spouse is close to retirement or the relationship lasted so long that a permanent stake in the others career is warranted...but in most cases, there is a termination date involved.

I can concede that it is more than possible for men to become subject to unfair rulings.  However, I don't think unfair outcomes necessarily reflect unfair principles.  Usually, when something unfair happens it is because the case was not handled properly by the parties or the Judge; this is not the fault of the laws themselves, or the principles behind them.","{'men', 'man'}"
"Originalism is a constitutional interpretive doctrine in which one reads the provisions of the Constitution to retain the meaning that they had when they were originally adopted.  Thus, an originalist (such as Justice Scalia) would say that if the First Amendment was not understood to prohibit public school prayer in 1791, it should not do so today; and if the Fourteenth Amendment was not understood to guarantee a right to same-sex marriage in 1868, it should not do so today.  The rationale for this is that the people, through their representatives, only actually properly ratified those original meanings, so those are the only meanings that should be considered law.  I take no position, in this post, on the correctness of this general originalist philosophy or its underlying justification, except that at the very least I don't think it's blatantly un-reasonable.

In interviews and concurrences/dissents, Scalia often brings up the Eighth Amendment in explaining his philosophy, and his frustration with the idea that current Supreme Court precedent applies the ""evolving standards of decency"" test, which he passionately opposes. As I understand it, the standard originalist argument against the extension of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments clause of the Eighth Amendment to, say, the death penalty, goes something like this:

 The people adopted the Eighth Amendment in 1791, and thus forbade ""cruel and unusual punishments"".  
 Another amendment (the Fifth) adopted at the same time specified some rights of a defendant charged with a capital offense.  Captial offense means one you can be executed for.
 Moreover, they kept on executing felons afterwards, and no one really thought this was incompatible with the Bill of Rights they had just passed.
 Thus, the Eighth Amendment can't possibly prohibit the death penalty.

Of course, this is entirely correct, assuming principles of originalism.  So, thus, the originalist-interpreted Eighth Amendment prohibits only those punishments that were considered ""cruel and unusual"" in 1791.

Now, I think it has to go the other way, too.  So if, hypothetically, the modern government wanted to torture someone as punishment, I think any originalist would have to call that unconstitutional as well, even if there was popular support for it, since that was clearly one of the things the Eighth Amendment proscribed when it was adopted.  

So, it seems to me that the proper originalist reading of the Eighth Amendment is one where it prohibits some discrete set of punishments (such as those involving torture), a set whose elements are defined as those punishments that the Framers and/or American society would have found ""cruel and unusual"" (compared to the crime) in 1791, and that set cannot ever change, regardless of how society or the Supreme Court or anything else changes.  Nothing can be added to or removed from that set without a Constitutional amendment.  

Fine.  But what basis is there, then, for not using the same rule when interpreting the other provisions of the Eighth Amendment?  If the same logic is used, the Excessive Bail and Excessive Fines clauses should be interpreted as forbidding a discrete set of bail amounts and fines (paired with certain crimes) that were considered ""excessive"" by the Framers and/or American society in 1791.  And that set can never change, regardless of how society or the Supreme Court or anything else changes.

I can't think of any reason why inflation, which I think can be fairly described as ""evolving standards of currency"", should be seen as fundamentally different from the same ""evolving standards of decency"" factor that Scalia and other originalists object to so strongly.  During oral argument in Hollingsworth v. Perry, Scalia asked the respondents' attorney when prohibiting same-sex marriage became unconstitutional.  Scalia's own answer to that, of course, would be ""not in 1868, obviously, which means never"".  In that same vein, though, when did it cease to be unconstitutional to set bail at $1 million, which would surely have been considered ludicrously excessive for any bailable offense in 1791?

I don't think most originalists actually hold this view, but I really don't see a principled reason why not, and so as a result, this is my view.  That said, I honestly do believe there likely is such a reason, and that I just haven't thought of it.  So, CMV.","{'his', 'he'}"
"Everyone is constantly reminded that the military is keeping us free with their sacrifices. They make it sound like without them, we'd be enslaved by Arabs.

However, I don't believe that there were any large scale operations since the second world war which was fought for our freedom. Even the cold war was a political battle carried out to maintain economic interests.

In the past two decades or so, our military operations are even more questionable, and can be considered purely offensive. I fail to see how sending patrols around a country in their own civil war has any benefit to our country. I don't think anyone realistically expects any terrorist organization to obtain an air force or navy of any strength, much less develop the logistics to carry out an attack across the Atlantic ocean.

On a more controversial note, most soldiers aren't very talented people either. The military is seen as a place where you enlist after high school if you don't have money or the grades to go to higher education.

Sure, there are many rich families who carry a tradition of going into the military, but even then they're more often than not ROTC.

Everyone keeps on thanking the servicemen. What exactly are we thanking them for? Without them, we'd be just as free and noticeably richer as well. We should feel sorry for soldiers instead, for signing up as pawns for the politicians chess game. They haven't done anything of worthy service to the country in years.

It's unquestionable that Americans are overdoing the military. Just look at the budget and waste. 

Edit: View has been changed to respect their initiative to improve their own lives for a stable middle class career. 

The US volunteering to police the world for peace at my cost is not something that I'm too happy with, but may be a necessary evil.

Why we're thanking the troops for ""service"" and regarding them as heroes is something I still don't see.

In order to turn around this unsustainable terror and war machine, the public has to change their perception of the military from selfless servicemen to empathy/pity for the poor kids who had no other path to follow but sought for discipline/future.

"This view can be interchangeable with any race, but in my experience, it is made by white, liberal Americans. 

Just recently I was in a discussion with a social justice warrior type and they said they would rather be born white then black, all things equal. I find this statement to be quite racist. 

For one, I've never heard a black friend, peer or coworker say they would rather did born white. For that matter, I haven't heard anyone of any race say they would rather have been born any other race or even their own. 

I recently read an interview with Ta-nehisi Coats where he was the beauty of black people. 

Interviewer: Speaking of beauty, and seeing things for the fullness of what they are, early on in the book you talk about your time at Howard, and how you discovered the majesty of black people while on the Yard. Can you talk more about your time there, and how it shaped your years after that?

Coats: I grew up around black people, but I didn’t grow up around black people like that. Howard pulls from the entire black diaspora. And black people, being human beings first and foremost, there is a great variation among them. And to see all that variation united under one thing, and yet still be individuals—I had never seen anything like that. It gave me a great respect for how full the black experience really was. How much it really meant, and how big it was. Somebody once told me, black people, in and of themselves, are cosmopolitan. There’s cosmopolitanism within the black experience. There’s an incredible amount. It’s an incredible thing, and I first saw that at Howard.

I thought this was a particularly moving explanation of his black experience. He doesn't appear to have any regrets for being born black and appears to be proud of who he is and the racial and ethnic culture he was born and raise in. 

That being said, people who say that they would rather be born white, I think it diminishes those who are born black and can be restated as ""white is better than black so I would choose to be white.""","{'he', 'his'}"

The texts/phone conversations between the two equipment managers:

1. One giving the other a ""heads up"" that his name came up in an interview with NFL Security.

2. Multiple references to Brady's preferences of the PSI of game balls and of providing a needle for use.

3. In the context of an exchange about the pressure of game balls, one said to the other that Brady ""actually brought you up and said you must have a lot of stress trying to get them done."" Mcnally's only assigned responsibility regarding game balls was to deliver them. What is there to ""get done?""

4. One expressing anger with Brady states that ""the only thing deflating sunday is his passing rating.""

5. One refers to himself as ""the deflator"" and jokes about ""not going to ESPN ... yet.""

6. Multiple requests for autographed gear from Tom Brady.

7. One says to the other ""I have a big needle for you this week."" The response is ""Better be surrounded by cash and new kicks... or its a rugby sunday"". When asked about this message by investigators, Mcnally confirmed that the reference to ""rugby"" meant an over-inflated football.

8. About a week before the AFCCG, one told the other it would be a ""big autograph day for you."" Several days later, Brady signed 2 footballs and a game-worn jersey and handed them to Mcnally in the equipment room.

Brady ordered his phone that had been used the past 4 months to be destroyed. Even though the phone was talked about in the investigation, he failed to tell them this until several weeks later. Brady says it is what he does with old phones when he gets a new one, but he gave NFL investigators an older phone before that. He was told his own lawyer could select the communications off his personal cellphone that were of interest to the league and send them those specific records, so the excuse of his personal privacy is irrelevant. He says in his recent Facebook post that his old phone was broken, but in the appeal he offered no explanation as to why his phone was replaced the exact day the investigators visited.

Brady claims he does not focus on inflation levels, but he always requested his balls be inflated to the lowest legal level. He complained about over-inflated footballs in a previous 2014 game, and in an interview had said 12.5 PSI was ""the perfect grip for him"". His claim is a blatant lie.

EDIT: Prior to the start of the game, Mcnally removed the Patriots' footballs form the Officials' Locker Room without informing or receiving permission from any of the game's officials, then he went to a small bathroom and locked the door even though he had access to the facilities in the Officials' Locker Room.

Many people in that thread agree with /u/spez there. That to fight racism, we need to debate racism with the racists. I think this line of thinking is naive, and simply wrong, for these reasons:  

1) There is mountains of scientific evidence that climate change exists (and is a result of human activities) and there is also mountains of evidence of the efficacy of vaccines. No serious, respected group of scientists deny this. Yet, the way the media has addressed these topics (which is to give ""both sides"" of the ""debate"" an equal platform/time) has not resulted in these positions declining in belief among the general public. The BBC has just recognized this, a bit late though. The anti-vaxxer movement is going strong, and has grown thanks to many ""debates"" being put on air. There are politicians in the U.S. Congress who don't believe in climate change. Open debate does not help to weed out such positions, clearly. 

2) While I can't say how effective ""silencing the opposition"" is, I disagree with the idea what ""not giving them a platform"" is the same thing as silencing. Nobody is stopping them from shouting what they have to say over the Internet in their blogs and websites. What shouldn't happen is pretending giving them the respect of an open debate and claiming that both sides have merit. You wouldn't bring on a KKK member to argue with a civil rights activist on TV, why should reddit?

3) reddit as a platform itself is very ill-suited to the style of ""open debate"" that /u/spez and his supporters claim will be enough to weed out the racism in society. The upvote/downvote system and the userbase's affinity for liking long arguments that sound logical and scientific is perfect fodder for the white supremacist's style of argumentation, which is basically a Gish Gallop. You inundate your opponent with a bunch of links and cherry-picked facts to strongly suggest but never outright state a conclusion (that black people are inferior) which leaves you a lot of lee-way with claiming victory over your debate opponent. Plus, the general disdain for any explanation that deals with ""SJW"" terms and explanations makes it harder for anyone to side with you. The white supremacists come to the debate with the intention to win an argument, not to debate. So unless you're equally as prepared with your own walls-of-text copypasted, you'll lose unless you have the hours (and the brigade of supporters) to deal with them.

4) As an addendum to #1 and #3, given how the issue of race and biology, sociology, etc. are still not nearly as understood as how vaccines are necessary and how climate change is happening, giving them an equal platform gives them an even better shot than the anti-vaxxers and climate change deniers in converting people to their ideology. Dylann Storm Roof became a racist after he looked into intentionally misleading copypasta of black crime statistics posted by the Council of Conservative Citizens. And you can see where that led him.

I think for these reasons that /u/spez's reason for not banning a place like /r/coontown is naive and possibly dangerous.

That being said, I'm not exactly sure what the right way to combat ignorance and hate is. Better education in our public schools would probably be a good first step.  

Alternatively, we could follow the example in the story of the Racist Tree.

"With the big witch hunt going on for the hunter who killed Cecil the lion, people are in an uproar over this guy because he likes to hunt animals for pleasure. Morally, I don't see this as any different from anyone who eats meat. Nobody needs to eat meat and it isn't healthier, it's something people do just for pleasure. Even though you aren't doing the act yourself, by eating meat you are contributing to far greater suffering than a hunter ever could, with the horrible conditions throughout modern livestock through far greater numbers of animals. Just because you aren't pulling the trigger doesn't remove the responsibility, you are still causing the exploitation and death of hundreds of animals.

Again, I do eat meat, but I'm just pointing out that these two situations are moral equivalents.","{'he', 'hunter', 'guy'}"

Let me be clear, I'm not vegan.  I eat meat regularly though probably less frequently than most Americans.  I'm also not really upset about this dude who bought a permit and license to hunt a lion and then went ahead and killed one.  I wish he hadn't; I think it's messed up that this sort of thing even exists; I wouldn't do it in a million years.  

But, I also understand that I morally don't have the right to be upset about one animal being murdered for the enjoyment of a human if my habits actively encourage the murder of literally billions of animals each year, simply because bacon tastes good.  Pork chops taste good, too.

"I'm not inherently against realistic games, but resent their ubiquity as well as the fact that they're the top priority.  I see most of the games in the store, and they just don't speak to me.  I enjoyed Brothers A Tale of Two Sons far more than Red Dead Redemption, The Witcher 3 and Skyrim.

1. Games were invented as an abstract expression.  In the NES days, games weren't literal and drawn to scale.  Mario wasn't literally jumping on turtles.  I appreciate games today wanting to add story and human elements, but all games will ever be (in terms of immersion) is an abstraction with more realistic sprites. 

2. With realistic graphics, there's little room for imagination now that everything is literally represented.  With games like Doom and The Wind Waker, you could fill in plenty of blanks and make lots of assumptions about where you were.  

3. Realistic games have a short shelf life.  In 3 years, people aren't going to care.  Notice how Bioshock 1 still looks great from an artistic perspective to this day, but Call of Duty Modern Warfare (released the same year) looks ugly.

4. Being wow'ed by realistic graphics is a hedonic treadmill.  When a big graphical leap comes, you're at first amazed at how far video games have come.  Shortly after, it's just another game with good graphics.  Why chase a fleeting moment?

5. We've had too many realistic games in the past 10.  When Crysis and Gears of War came out, they looked amazing.  Now every game looks like that.

6. Current gen consoles aren't a big step up, compared to leaps in previous generations.  Even remasters are starting to push the hardware limits.  Going to 1080p today wasn't nearly as significant as the jump to HD in 2005 or the jump to 3D in 1995.  There's only so much you can do with realism this gen.

7. Realistic graphics usually result in (sports aside) games that are violent.  They're ubiquitous.  Ubisoft has made 11 Assassin Creed games but can't make 1 3D Rayman game.  Sony abandoned Jak for more violent titles.  Violent games aren't inherently bad (I enjoyed games like L.A. Noire and The Last of Us), but don't people get tired of playing the same game over and over?  Don't people get tired of shooting soldiers or beating up zombies all of the time?

8. There are more important priorities.  Story, characters, player reward/motivation systems, depth of mechanics, balance of meta/strategies, unique online/social experiences, user created content sharing and such.

EDIT: Thank you for all the responses.  I'm going to still keep replying.

I was inspired to make this thread by seeing realistic demos of Zelda such as Ocarina's Temple of Time on the Unreal engine or Nintendo's Wii U tech demo.  And I'm not by principle against realistic Zelda.  I'd love to have one when technology can handle it without costs being crazy.  But just because someone looks amazing in a trailer, doesn't mean the game will be anymore amazing than Ocarina of Time's graphics when we actually play it.  It will be something like.  Wow!!!  Zelda looks real!!! ...Now what?

"After a couple philosophy classes and some long winded discussions it seems as though many people find it hard to believe that free will doesn't exist in any real scientific way.

Let's start off with premise #1

 Everything that is observable in the universe follows laws of nature. All laws of nature follow the universal law of causation, which states that everything in the universe has a cause and is thus an effect of that cause. 

If premise #1 is true then everything in the physical world must be determined. 

If everything is determined than there is no such thing as free will.
If every behaviour is determined by laws of causation it is physically impossible for someone to be free, as that freedom would require the nullification of the laws of causation. In other words to believe in free will is also to believe in spontaneous magic, it's to believe that humans possess powers that could only be explained by the supernatural.

For example: In most legal traditions it is customary to judge whether someone is guilty of x crime by accumulating evidence in order to prove that  x person intentionally did this crime. Let's assume that there was enough evidence to prove without doubt that Greg Smith robbed a convenience store. Now that we have proof that it was Greg, we should ask ourselves if Greg really chose to rob the store. As soon as you ask yourself that kind of question the only scientific recourse you have is to understand Greg as a causal agent. What caused Greg to rob the store? Was it the fact that Greg is from a low socio-economic class? Was it the fact that Greg lost his job 2 weeks ago and Greg wont be able to feed his kids if he doesn't find a way to get more money? Is it the fact that Greg was abused as child? Did Greg rob the store due to complex laws of causality that are reducible to both biological and environmental reasons? Or did Greg simply rob the store because he felt like it?

Even more simple decisions like choosing between a chocolate bar and an apple can be reducible to complex causal interplay between biological and environmental laws. Did you choose the chocolate bar because you like it better? Or is it because we have an evolutionary pull towards sugar and fat dense food? Is it because you read an article on naturalnews.com talking about how dark chocolate can cure your pancreas cancer? Or did you chose the apple because you grew up on an orchard farm and apples remind you of your innocent childhood? or did you choose the apple because you already had psychologically determined bias for foods that will fit in your limited calorie budget for the week?


What I am trying to say is that as soon as you try to define freedom of choice scientifically it inevitably reduce down to causal mechanisms. Whether those casual mechanisms are internal/biological or external/environmental or a mix of both they are the only things that influence us and completely shape our behaviour. Anything else that can be said to have a role in our behaviours (like our ""independent volition"", our ""moral compass"" and all other notions pertaining to freedom of will) is inherently unscientific and can only be explained through a belief in the supernatural.

"A lot of futuristic technology has floundered lately (3D TV, Google Glass, etc.) but Amazon Echo can be incredibly harmful if it takes off.

Watch the launch video to understand what Amazon Echo is.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQn6aFQwBQU) If you don't have the time, this is the pitch:

Amazon Echo is designed around your voice. It's hands-free and always on. With seven microphones and beam-forming technology, Echo can hear you from across the room—even while music is playing. Echo is also an expertly tuned speaker that can fill any room with immersive sound.

Echo connects to Alexa, a cloud-based voice service, to provide information, answer questions, play music, read the news, check sports scores or the weather, and more—instantly. All you have to do is ask.

Essentially, it is an omnipresent Siri that lives in your home and is constantly listening. The device already has 23,058 reviews from testers and it is just hitting the market. Now imagine one of these in everyone's home. I will cover some of the highlights of the launch video as examples in my argument.

---

Reason 1: Laziness

A lot of technology today encourages laziness. However, this takes it to a whole new level.

Example: ""Alexa, add waffles to my shopping list."" Now we don't even need to jot things down or even type them into our smart phones at the very least.

Example: 'Alexa can provide news!' Instead of reading the newspaper or watching the news we can listen to a mono-tone robot recite world events.

Example: ""Alexa, what is the chance of rain?"" The woman is literally standing next to the door when she asks this question. However, she would rather receive the weather from her nifty new gadget than to actually look outside or watch a weather report.

---

Reason 2: Reliance on Technology

Most of us can admit that we are uncomfortably dependent on our smart phones. However, what if our smart phone was never in our pocket? What if it was always plugged in and tempting us? This is essentially Amazon Echo. The narrator even proclaims that Echo will, ""Become a part of the family!""

Example: ""The echo is a tool that we use to keep our household functioning."" This is a quote from a mother as she dresses her daughter. I am aware that these are commercially invented situations being reenacted by paid actors. However, I feel as though they are fairly accurate depictions of how people will use this technology and how they will respond to it. Clearly, there are many issues with one piece of technology keeping a household together.

Example: ""The prime re-ordering is when you can ask Alexa to order something you've already ordered through your prime account."" Now we can shop by shouting a phrase at a robot! No need to go out.

I think laziness coupled with reliance on technology have been the most harmful qualities that todays youth (myself included) suffer from. We find it difficult to go out and make plans. We find it difficult to socialize. We find it difficult to talk on the phone. In a world full of constant updates and fast information, why should we access things in any other way? We want things instantaneously and at our discretion.

---

Reason 3: Invasion of Privacy

Major corporations will do anything to learn more about consumers and what they want. Echo allows consumers to order things through Amazon Prime. I am not afraid of what this AI will do granted that it can always hear and learn. As long as it's just a black cylinder speaker (with no hidden flame-thrower) I don't believe we have a reason to fear an Echo uprise. Rather, I am more afraid of what the men and women behind the scenes will do. 

Example: 'Echo can hear you from anywhere in the room, so it's always ready to help!' ""I can have the water running, I can be cooking, the TV can be on in the back room, and she still can hear me."" 

All I could think while watching this was, ""Genisys is Skynet!""

"Our house has a guest bathroom that rarely gets used. I tend to leave the door open and my dog will sometimes drink out of it. I just flush it to ""refresh"" the water and call it a day.

People have remarked that it's gross though. I don't see how. The water is clean, and even if the toilet bowl has germs on it I've seen my dog eat poop before, I don't think a little urine in his beard will kill him. Plus I end up cleaning the bathroom semi-regularly anyway.

"I am friends with a woman on facebook who does drag. She has a young son (10) who she dresses up (I have to think she dresses him, as he is not old enough to attain his own clothes) as a girl. It has gotten to the point where she has made a fan page for him where she constantly posts pictures of him in his drag/ female attire.

Are children able to consciously make a decision like that, which will likely effect their entire schooling experience, at such a young age? Or is it a ""dress like mommy does"" case, where the parent allows it because they are so affluent in that lifestyle?

I am all for gender equality, fluidity, and expressing yourself how you see fit. But I have a hard time believing that a child can choose that and they want to begin to pave their life after that when their brain is developing. It almost feels forced and that the parent is making that choice for them. It also kind of rubs me the wrong way that the parent posts all these public pictures of her son on Facebook in a fan page, none the less. Should he not be able to decide who sees his lifestyle choices? He obviously doesn't have a facebook, being that he's 10, so I very seriously doubt that he was asked if its ok.

Regardless, change my view!!! ","{'he', 'his', 'him', 'son'}"
"I had a conversation with a friend a few weeks ago, where I spoke of having children. His response that was that it was selfish and actually quite brutal due to the energy that my offspring would consume in it's lifetime. 

There are simply other ways to solve the environmental problems we currently have. Population control is a completely reactive, knee-jerk solution. 

Slowing down consumerism by giving corporations less power than they already have would be a good start. The big corporates are the ones that are destroying parts of the planet to find more energy and consuming mass amounts of energy to manufacture products. Due to globalisation, the problem we have nowadays is that these corporations are so big that its hard to hold individuals accountable and and they are so powerful that it's hard for the masses to stand up to them. because a lot of the time we think we have a reliance on what they are providing.

Change our attitude as individuals. We need to be more conscious in regards to how we affect the our ecosystems and the planet as a whole. We rarely think about what had to be done to create the plastic packaging from the food we eat, or what has to be done to power our homes. There needs to be more awareness here. Too often I hear people will not recycle because other countries don't and they don't see the point. It is also hard to convince individuals to take this attitude and not leave their lights on when they go out at night when Las Vegas is constantly lit like a Christmas Tree.

It's almost like we need a substantial event to take place before it is indeed too late, the energy issue is starting to pick up traction but we need to move quicker. It absolutely must be on top of every political agenda of every government in the world.

Which brings me to my last point, a friend once questioned why people in third world countries mainly in Africa would continue to have children and that they needed to be educated and discouraged from this as they are contributing to the exponential population growth we are currently enduring. Developed countries consume a lot more than developing countries.

Some of you may argue that countries with larger populations need more energy, I ague back that Indonesia's population is only 29% less than that of the United States. However the consumption of the United States is 95% more than Indonesia. 

I say again, the problem is not the size of the population just the actions we are currently carrying out. There are enough square miles for every human being on this planet ten times over. 

Lastly, I do think there is some legitimacy to this claim. But more people do not necessarily mean more energy consumption. I don't have any empirical evidence and will try to get some but I can bet a family of 6 in East Africa consume a lot less than your average family of 3 in the United States.

"I see memes and statements all the time around the idea that ""offense is taken not given"". Usually in the context of someone protesting that something is offensive, and people poking fun at them for the unreasonableness of the offense they took.

But while I would agree it is possible to behave as if something is far more offensive than most reasonable people would agree it is, this is a qualitatively different issue than ""offense is given not taken"".

Stoicism is the ancient philosophy that pain and suffering can be made far more endurable by your reaction to it; specifically, deliberate indifference shields you from suffering. The stoic solution to pain and misfortune is to refuse to let it dominate you and therefore reduce its ultimate harm.

Similar ideas of detaching yourself from suffering or seeking value in painful experiences can be found in Buddhism and Existentialism. Viktor Frankl, holocaust survivor, wrote Man's Search for Meaning about how focusing on the positive and meaningful aspects of life in the midst of a horrible experience helped him and other's survive and rebuild their lives.

So I agree with the notion that someone can stoically endure offensive behavior, and I'd even agree with the idea that this is, for the individual, the least mentally stressful or distracting way of dealing with these experience. This doesn't necessarily mean complete internalization - passivity is not the same as stoicism.

The problem I have is with anyone asserting that because offense is 'taken and no given', bad behavior should not be called out, or should be suffered silently. Words and actions can betray sordid underlying attitudes. They can make people feel unwelcome. Saying that people should silently tolerate this emotional harm from offensive remarks because they control their own attitudes is like saying people should silently tolerate any harm or injustice, simply because they can (according to stoicism).

Let's step back to the specific case of the 'unreasonably sensitive'.

If you are drunk and shove someone, we'd probably agree that it's a bit hysterical and even unreasonable for that person to sue you for assault. But you are still in the wrong; you've done something wrong and you could have saved yourself the trouble by not shoving them.

And if that person had a bizarre medical condition where his skull was eggshell thing and he fell over and shattered his skull, then you'd definitely be liable, and 'he shouldn't have been out in a bar, where people shove people' or 'he should have worn a football helmet' or 'he should have kept his balance' or 'he should endure his serious skull injury without suffering because of the existential meaninglessness of all our lives which forces us to find meaning subjectively' are all horrible excuses that won't and shouldn't help you in court!

If you bumped into this man by accident with the same result, you'd not be a criminal, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try to watch where you're going and not accidentally knock them over.

The same goes for emotional harm. Some people really are emotionally fragile and some aren't themselves but like to advocate for those who are. And maybe like the thin-skulled man shouldn't become a boxer there are some decisions the emotionally fragile should make carefully, but that doesn't mean you should go around shoving people and insulting those who call you out.

TL;DR To change my view, convince me that there is something substantially differentiating offense from other types of harm and suffering that justifies ""offense is taken not given"" as a reaction to those saying a thing is offensive, rather than defense of the thing itself. Or attack from another angle you think of.","{'his', 'man', 'he', 'him'}"
"Frieza was a psychotic mass murderer and tyrant but was generally very collected emotionally. Rather than destroy planets for pure entertainment he cleared them out and sold them to species with a need for a new world. It was evil of course, but there was a certain logic to it and seeing as he was just one tyrant in the vastness of the universe it was somewhat unlikely that he'd ever find your world. 

Had he not destroyed the Saiyans every other species in the galaxy or universe would have been destroyed.

Saiyans are completely insane. Had Goku not been raised by humans his and his father's ridiculous powers would have been used, more likely lazily guided, by King Vegeta to commit relentless genocide. Saiyans double their power after they almost die, they can turn into giant apes so powerful that five can exterminate all life from one planet, and for whatever reason they can continuously transform into more and more powerful beings. Their ability to turn super saiyan seems to be rather easy if they face enough significant challenges, and their singular interest in combat ensures that they will meet more threats and, rather than get crippled or exhausted, they will only get more powerful after each challenge. Further they don't seem to age as most creatures do, remaining with the physique of a thirty year old well into their autumn years.

It would appear that the Saiyans were a relatively young species by the time Frieza destroyed them. They conquered planet Tuffle from a nearby moon and established themselves as a civilized species all within the reign of the first and last King Vegeta, going on to introduce themselves to nearby worlds with mass destruction and genocide. Goku and Vegeta's unlimited strength would suggest that eventually, if the Saiyans survived as a species, there could be hundreds of Super Saiyan 3's and 4's wreaking havoc all over the galaxy for no reason other than pure sport. Broly, yet another powerful Saiyan, appears capable of destroying several worlds in a matter of minutes without even needing a spaceship.

In essence, given a few centuries of constant battle, there would have been thousands of Super Saiyans with the same world-destroying power of Frieza. While he destroyed the species for his own selfish reasons and fears he ensured that, for a time, he was the only individual besides Broly (and later Buu) capable of destroying worlds with ease. This ensured that, statistically, the likelihood of having your world destroyed in the largeness of the universe by one of these three individuals was quite low. 

Now imagine billions of Saiyans, billions Brolys Gokus and Vegetas, billions of relentlessly bloodthirsty fighters, capable of transforming into giant apes and having unlimited power ups, fighting and killing purely for the insatiable thrill and fun of it. Goku and Vegeta, even after becoming righteous individuals, clearly demonstrate no interest beyond fighting and eating. Sex, pursuit of knowledge, spending time with family, art... these are at best tertiary interests. Frieza, at the very least, enjoyed having his much weaker minions do much of his fighting for him meaning theoretically one could be spared genocide by a chance encounter with him. There is no avoiding genocide after a Saiyan scouting party discovers your world. 

If in the infinite vastness of the universe there was a planet Vegeta that shared it with our Earth, ideally far away from the Earth Goku eventually landed on with its King Dogs and Dragon Balls chances are we would have been exterminated for no reason beyond the amusement of a species of irreconcilably insane monsters; and Frieza's atrocity spared us all.

"EDIT: ""not a good series"" is unfair, as for one, ""good"" is subjective, and it clearly has some merit or so many people wouldn't like it. I'm adjusting the title to ""Not the best series ever"", because that's the thing I take issue with. :P

I had this argument with a friend, and it reminded me that for some reason, every single ""top 10"" or ""top 100"" best games list always has at least one Legend of Zelda game in it. I've never understood why this series is so loved.

Apparently Ocarina Of Time is considered by most the best, so I forced myself to play through a decent chunk of it. Here are some of the major issues I had.

1. There's a massive world, but you're not allowed to explore it. Everything is behind lock-and-key puzzles, so you might as well just go to places in the order the game wants.

2. 90% of the characters are cardboard cutouts who don't do anything.

3. There's so much padding. It's got more bear asses than Warcraft.

4. Ganon seems to be generic ""mwahaha I'm evil!"" bad guy, maybe he gets some more character development in the other games, but in OoT he feels like a 90s disney villain.

5. Half the items seem to be completely useless.

6. The combat makes skyrim seem exciting.

7. Playing the Ocarina to solve puzzles feels more like entering cheat codes.

"Consent, I think we can agree, is a basic requirement for sex to be a positive act. Consent allows for there to be communication and reassurance between whoever is involved that what they're doing, and how they're doing it, is okay with their partner(s). Consent also allows for things that would otherwise be creepy or weird to come into a positive light and expressed in a healthy way. I would consider the act of objectifying to fall under this category. For example, a woman may be creeped out if a dude right in front of her at a party is just staring at her boobs without any concern for her at all. The same act of staring at the boobs is 100% fine if it's with her boyfriend while they're having consensual sexual relations.

If we take this same line of logic of consent that happens with sex and put it with masturbation, that's where I'm going with this. If you're thinking about another person in a sexual manner without them knowing about it, and then acting out that thought process by masturbating, it just seems a bit creepy to me. If I'm not allowed to objectify or do other sexual acts in person without having consent from the other person, I don't see how that wouldn't also translate over to masturbation. It's the same sexual thoughts, feelings, and intentions with the only difference being that the partner is not physically with you. Because they're not there with you, you can't ask for proper consent unless you physically ask them some other time if you can masturbate about them.

This line of thought has logic to it, but it's a conclusion that I don't like to face. This line of thought potentially makes masturbation an awful act if done without consent. It also makes it an act that wouldn't be allowed if no one gave any consent to you. You might be able to say that pornography that was paid for might be consensual masturbation because the model is being paid, and is therefore willing to consent to you masturbating. Even so, this doesn't allow you to explore your sexual desires outside of straight up porn unless someone says it's okay. If you asked me whether I'm for or against masturbation, I would say that I'm very pro-masturbation. The act has health benefits, relieves stress, is pleasurable, and all sorts of other fun goodies. It makes it so I don't want to come to the conclusion that I've come to that it needs strict consent about the person(s) that's involved in one's fantasies.

So please, CMV!

EDIT: After reading over the many replies I've gotten (thank you all) I think my view has already sufficiently changed. Consent with masturbation has more of a tendency to be harmful than helpful and positive. There's a difference between one's thoughts and actions, and masturbation causes no harm if the one being fantasied about isn't informed. There was also the argument that ones thoughts and fantasies should be their own, and no one else's. Control of your own thoughts is a human necessity, and putting a limit on them could be hazardous. As long as I keep a mental image of someone in tact of who they are, and not just seeing them as a sex object, I think it's all fine and dandy.

Thanks guys. I felt like I must've been wrong with my logic somewhere, and you helped point to where. I needed that. :)

"I know this might be considered a low hanging fruit, and let me know if it is, but I have a friend who is overall very intelligent, yet this is something we argue about once in a while and I was hoping for some opinions that we can read together and come to a conclusion. I've noticed these arguments occur with many people who consider themselves feminist (actual not tumblr). 

Personally I believe that there are issues with treatment of both genders. Women have higher rates of rape outside prison, a very small but statistically significant pay gap (~95:100), stricter standards of beauty, some discrimination in STEM fields in professional environments, general treatment at skill levels, domestic violence rates, sex ed in certain regions, Madonna/Whore complex treatment, etc. I also believe men have issues such as higher rates of workplace injuries and death, PTSD due to higher enlisting rates, treatment towards mental health issues, homelessness, mate selection, physical violence, university enrolment and graduation rates, punishment for the same crime, paternity and divorce issues, etc.

In the end I don't believe that one gender has a clear advantage over the other. I believe that both genders have issues they face in modern society, and to quantify them would take away from the struggles of either. Hence despite agreeing on many points with feminism, I would not be considered a feminist because I don't agree with the core belief that women are the oppressed gender. This seems to bother my friend who feels strongly about feminism, because despite the fact that we agree on many points, that one distinction is not something we agree on. He finds it insulting that I would compare out-of-prison rapes to something like PTSD from war in terms of statistics of percentage occurring to each gender. Personally I find it shitty because he doesn't acknowledge that men have some serious issues as well, and no one gender is undoubtedly superior in the eyes of society. 

In many other parts of the world, I agree with him 100%; women are significantly more oppressed in many Islamic countries for example. I just think the only factor in which men are clearly superior in practice and eyes of society are physical abilities, but otherwise both genders deal with some horrible things and no one gender is undoubtedly oppressed.","{'he', 'men', 'him'}"

A woman who says they identify more as a man than a women because of A B C but does not want to be a man is essentially playing into gender roles.

"This topic is very broad. Lately it seems most of social movements in America focus on gender, sexual orientation, race, or health. Personally I think the conversations are healthy, but the pushes for equality are futile. Take feminism, for example. The whole point is to empower women, but citing general statistics, like women are paid a fraction of every dollar a man makes, or encouraging women in STEM fields with scholarships don't feel very empowering. I think we can all agree that misogyny is bad and that scholarships are good, but knowing that you only ended up somewhere because you met the right quota isn't rewarding.

I'm not saying welfare or charities are bad by any means, but the way we go about supporting underprivileged people is wrong. Everything has its token minority in some way. Shouldn't we let people's work stand on its own?

If someone does something outstanding, does it make it better that he was a minority? Everyone fights so hard for equality, but everyone also goes ""Aww, look he did this cool thing, even though he's transexual/African/obese/Asian/schizophrenic/a mother/a father/etc.""

At the core, everyone has an advantage over another in some way. All these movements seem to do is step on somebody's toes (not inherently a bad thing!) in a condescending way. I mean the Declaration of Independence guarantees the ""Life, Liberty, and pursuit of happiness"" to every person. Every single person deserves those rights, but not every single person deserves to have things given to them. CMV.","{'he', 'man'}"
"I believe people are either born straight or born gay. That isn't a choice.

However the idea that someone could be BORN bisexual I don't agree with. Yes, there are bisexual people. But I do believe that is something that is learned over time and is a choice.

A straight man can LEARN to like men sexually. He can learn to enjoy it. Right now, I could watch gay porn and eventually enjoy it even though I'm straight. Doesn't mean I'm actually bisexual and that I was born bisexual. Just means I learned to like men, however I ""prefer"" women.

I do not believe sexuality is fluid and is always changing. You're either born gay or straight. That is it.

How do you explain all the gay Craigslist ads with men labeling themselves as straight and looking for other men? How do you explain people saying they are evolving and experimenting? 

I know straight men who have had sex with other men, yet always go back to wanting a woman in their life. Want to marry a woman yet also have gay sex. They just ""enjoy"" gay sex.

I just don't take it seriously when people describe themselves as bisexual. I know that deep down they have a preference, and that preference usually shows their ""true"" sexuality.

How do you explain transgender people being thirdly split into straight, gay, and bisexual?

I have a friend who is a bisexual trans man. He says that he doesn't really label himself. However he has tons of gay sex. Yeah, he did have a girlfriend here and there. He told me that when he had sex with a girl, it didn't feel ""special/right"" as if he didn't enjoy it fully to the extent. So basically he is gay and just learned to like women because of what he went through as a trans man. So yes, gay people can also ""learn"" to be bisexual, but they aren't happy is what I'm saying. It isn't their true sexuality.

For what purpose would man be BORN bisexual? What could that possibly serve to mankind?

"Recently, Hilary Clinton has been in the news (x of the quote, and people started criticizing the people passing around the articles for taking things out of context / not doing their research.    

(Here's where my opinion comes in.) I think that tumblr's reputation of false alarm and out-of-context sound bites isn't unique to tumblr at all, it's the way popular American media has operated for the last few decades- if not more. Many have discussed the ""sound-bit culture"" that becomes especially popular in presidential election cycles. Given that this is the norm for modern day news, I think politicians have a responsibility to avoid creating problematic soundbites.   

Specifically, I think Clinton doesn't deserve the sympathy she's getting from people who feel as though the media took her quote out of context. Clinton has been a politician for DECADES, she's got more experience than practically anybody- she's gone through 2 successful presidential election campaign as a candidate's spouse and this is her second presidential campaign as a candidate herself. She's been in more controversy over the years than anybody can keep track of. She's got almost unanimous support from the Democratic party, and lord knows she can afford good speechwriters and campaign managers. So why in the hell would she deliver a speech with the sentiment of basically ""Black people are scary... is what a racist would say. Racism is bad."" Surely, she knows people are only gonna take the first bit of that clip, and they're gonna run with it.    

To me, the fact that this ""quotable"" passed through all the levels of Clinton's campaign team is just an indicator of how little anyone working for Clinton (including herself) really gives a shit. She could wake up tomorrow and say she intends on starting a nuclear war with Iran, and she'd still get the Democratic nomination. Because of that, I think the media has the right (and responsibility) to challenge Clinton. A good candidate is a candidate who's speeches can't be misquoted/taken out of context.    

We (the American people) are not getting the candidate we want or deserve, because we keep tripping over ourselves to help out Clinton.

"I have this view that the Beatles are overrated and I've been discussing it with my friend but like me he's also 19 years old so its hard to take what he has to say into consideration. 

My thinking is that they were one of the first pop bands, they made catchy music that people could sing along to. Since they were from Britain, and also played in the US they had even more people listening to their songs.

Sticking to my opinion that they were the first pop band, it doesn't make them better than other musicians/bands that came later. I brought up an example to my friend, Mother Love Bone was an early grunge band but that doesn't make them better than bands like Nirvana or Stone Temple Pilots.

"My friend told me it's uncool living with my mom still and I completely agree, but I think it's more impractical to throw away over 1000 for rent every month just to not be under the same roof. I have a close loving relationship with my mom and she's 62 that's starting to need some care. She lives alone in a ghetto area so I worry about her sometimes. That being said, having my own pad would be awesome but I live in Austin where everyone's moving here and causing price to skyrocket everywhere. I'm frugal and it hurts to not save with my money just for sake of freedom. I don't quite have enough to buy a place yet, and the living cost here is barely affordable where I would almost live by paycheck.  The biggest drawback to me is not being able to take a girl home, which I feel could be resolved once I start dating and having relationship with someone, then I feel would be appropriate to move out because we can split rent cost together and give me some breathing room financially. Bottom line, I feel the thousands of dollars saved a month outweighs the cost of living as a single bachelor even if it hurts my pride, although my friends disagrees. Thoughts?",{'bachelor'}
"I've seen a few posts lately that refer to the lady who spilled coffee on herself and then sued McDonald's for medical expenses, and I am completely bemused by the support for the lady. 

The jury found McDonald's to be 80% responsible and awarded several million dollars compensation, which was later reduced to about 600 000 dollars, and then later settled.

Acording to wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebeck_v._McDonald%27s_Restaurants) and another website here are the abridged facts of the incident as I understand them.

 coffee was ordered at a drive through window
 coffee was handed to Liebeck
 Liebeck's son drove off
 they stopped so Liebeck could add sugar
 Liebeck spilled the entire cup over her lap, hence severely injuring her

My argument that it is not McDonald's responsibility is that she had been safely handed the coffee. The transaction was complete and she had control. If the coffee had been spilled during the handover I would view it the other way around.

There are two arguments that I reject. I reject that the severity of the injury affects the responsibility. Comments such as ""have you seen those injuries, they're horrific, she had to be reconstructed"" are common. This is true, they were appalling injuries. But I think this is a strawman argument because my point is that it was not McDonald's responsibility after the handover, not that the injuries were minor. 

I reject that the coffee was too hot. These are hot drinks. It's obvious to me, and I would hope anyone who intends to drink such a drink that it would be hot and care should be given. Perhaps my culture views it differently. I grew up in England, and here 9 and ten year olds make tea for themselves; kettles boil water and then that water is poured into a teapot / cup. We know from a young age that this is dangerous and extreme care must be taken when handling such hot water. Indeed, in a similar UK case against McDonald's regarding hot coffee, the judge ruled that McDonald's was not responsible, one of the reasons being that people expect hot drinks to be hot and should make reasonable safety measures themselves. I do not believe Americans don't realise hot water is dangerous.

 If anyone would like to comment, I'd be happy to elaborate further. I look forward to having interesting discussion.

EDIT: Thank you for your replies so far, I'm working my way through replying to them.

EDIT: Thank you for your comments and discussion. I have awarded deltas to comments that highlighted arguments that I had not considered. My view is still that McDonald's were not liable for any costs. I have come to the conclusion that the discrepancy is due to a difference in cultural expectations of temperature of served hot drinks. I was brought up in a culture where water is regularly boiled at home and hence all children learn how to be careful around just-boiled water. As mentioned above, that is part of the reason why an almost identical case was thrown out in the UK.

"The most obvious refutation of the glass cliff hypothesis is that Yishan himself personally selected Pao, and she was soon after approved by the board. The claim that Pao was set up for failure holds the obvious implication ~~what~~ that Yishan set her up for failure. Despite this, Pao was originally stationed as CEO in the interim. Her role was never even intended to be permanent; how can she be set up on a glass cliff if she was only temporary in the first place? 

The glass cliff theory also includes the idea that the company was performing poorly at the time or was forecasted to perform poorly in the future. This is patently false; Pao presided over an enormous increase in user growth and revenues, a growth curve that had begun well before her promotion. Furthermore, the company's performance was the not the reason for her ouster; instead, it was due to user and moderator dissatisfaction; nothing that was present or predictable at the time of her promotion many months earlier. It is obvious, then, that none the parameters of the glass cliff thesis were met, and is instead a myth perpetuated by feminists media organizations seeking to portray Reddit as misogynistic and sexist.

"Some people like to argue that men have a more difficult development then woman do.  Here are some arguments they have:

1. ""After controlling for the arrest offense, criminal history, and other prior characteristics, ""men receive 63% longer sentences on average than women do,"" and ""women are…twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted.""https://www.law.umich.edu/newsandinfo/features/Pages/starr_gender_disparities.aspx
This fact does not support the politically correct notion that there is a ""war on women"" in the USA, or that America is patriarchal and full of ""male privilege"".  To the contrary, it says that women are more likely to be protected by society than men, and are given special ""female privileges"" which makes their development easier.

2. In the USA all male citizens MUST register with the Selective Service when they turn 18 so they can be drafted into war if ""needed"" and possibly die. This is a highly sexist law at its core. What would happen if we had a law that only drafted African-Americans, or Latinos, or people with blue eyes? Why don't we draft women? Should we? Some nations like Israel do.

3. If a woman and a man engage in sexual intercourse and pregnancy results, a woman can make decisions that disregards the man’s input but that affect him drastically. If the woman decides to terminate the pregnancy, the man has no legal say in the matter. And if the woman decides to continue the pregnancy, again without any discretion from the man, he is legally responsible for child support for 18 years. If he fails to support such a child he can have his wages garnished and/or be imprisoned. (Please note I AM NOT CLAIMING that a man SHOULD have a legal right here, just that he has no legal standing - it is entirely a woman's choice about how to deal with the pregnancy, and this gives her more control and power than a man in that circumstance) For example, a woman can have the baby and then give up a child for adoption against the man's wishes - http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/12/31/22124881-dad-files-130m-lawsuit-after-son-in-utah-is-given-up-for-adoption.

"First thing, let's assume the biblical Jesus is completely true. 

Now, I have a fair knowledge of the biblical tale, but if I say something wrong, feel welcome to correct me. I'll use the most ""accepted"" version of the story: 

Jesus was one with God, part of the Holy Trinity and one day he decided humanity should be saved with the ultimate sacrifice: his own life. In order to do that he came to Earth and lived like a normal human, teaching his ways to others. 30 and something years after his human birth he met his fate. Tortured and humiliated he sacrificed his life to give humanity a chance of redemption, he was the Lamb of God. After that he was resurrected and went back to heaven to live like god for the rest of eternity 


Alright, this is a big deal because a divine creature came to Earth to sacrifice himself for humans, an unthinkable act. Problem is, Jesus choices were:

1. Save humanity and suffer a lot of pain for a couple months (if you consider the very act of becoming human a bad thing, then let's say 30ish years) and go back to Heaven
2. Not save humanity and stay as god forever

Provided you're not completely cold and oblivious being, 1) is clearly the only logical choice here, you are trading an infinitely small piece of your life for saving an entire race that you created, why not? Compared to eternity the suffering is meaningless. It's like if for giving 1 cent to a person Bill Gates could save that persons life. Of course he would. Anyone would. You don't need to be pure goodness to do that, not even close.

So, what is the merit of Jesus sacrifice? ","{'he', 'his', 'himself'}"
"Hi all, 

I haven't thought this through in depth, but my gut reaction to Donald Trump's popularity is that he taps into the hatred for the political class more than anything else. He simply doesn't give a fuck about politicians, and is willing to call them out for being the shit they are. And the rest doesn't matter at all. I don't think it's primarily a racist element that supports him. I don't think it's that people have any clue about his politics even. No one really cares.

But the likes of John McCain and Lindsey Graham are well known for being war mongers who are totally full of shit and useless. Rick Perry is a complete idiot. Hillary Clinton, well, she's a Clinton... Nuff said. And Donald Trump is the only person in the race (other than Bernie Sanders) who opposes the existing political paradigm. Rand Paul had a chance to do this, his father did. But Rand clearly embraced the political class. Ted Cruz recognizes why Trump is popular, and is seeking the same votes, and that is why he refuses to criticize him. But Ted Cruz is boring with a nasal voice, is a politician, and he clearly comes off as a total asshole. So Trump has the protest vote all locked up.

But what the political class and the American media don't understand is that they are truly hated. The media and political class are currently trying to kill Trump's campaign, but they are doing so at their own peril. Because trump is not just a Ralph Nader or Jessie Ventura or Ron Paul (true believers with limited potential), he is a billionaire who truly hates the political class. His platform (does he have one?) has nothing to do with policy ideas, but is purely a reactionary reflection of the popular hatred of the Washington elite. and this hatred runs very deep. it was deep enough to kill Hillary Clinton's campaign last time around against a candidate with the exact same political views (who even appointed her a key member of his cabinet), and it is powerful enough to truly disrupt the political order.

Trump, more than any other candidate before him, has the potential to overthrow this political order, and that is why people support him. that is my view. change it.

"Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France seven times by taking EPO and--when a test for EPO was developed--by taking blood transfusions during the race to increase his red blood-cell levels. He passed all of the blood tests (shy one, where the story of using a particular ointment for saddle-sores was concocted to explain it).

Doping in one form or another is always going to happen, and there will always be another method that can escape detection. If you're a professional athlete, or an amateur competing in high profile tournaments such as the Olympics, then you either dope or you face a significant disadvantage.

I don't think this will ever change, and the consequence is that every winner will be tainted by doubt, so I think the only way to address this is to change the policy to allow specific types of doping.

Ball-shrinking, liver wrecking, life endangering drugs would still be banned for the safety of the athlete, but anything that's either harmless (blood transfusions), or at the same level as ""professional hazard"" (like brain damage for boxers), would be allowed.

One of the things that encourage me to have this view, and that I'd like addressed if it's wrong, is my understanding that the IOC relaxed their criteria for gender verification. 

The reason, as I understand it, is that there were simply too many legitimate side cases, so the hardline rule couldn't be enforced. Someone genetically male might have Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome or XX/XXY mosaicism, for example, and grow up looking like a woman to anyone but a gene lab.

 One form of gender identification, which was mandated for all female olympic athletes by the International Olympic Committee in 1992, tested for the presence of the SRY gene, which is found on the Y-chromosome, to identify males potentially disguised as females. This method of testing was later abolished, as it was shown to be inconclusive in identifying maleness.

"It seems that the only thing that ever is motivating any person at any point in time, is self interest.

""Selfless"" actions can easily be explained through people likely expecting themselves to act in this fashion as it is their own moral code which they are fulfilling. To them they would expect it of themselves and be disappointed if they didn't carry out the selfless action. behind all of this is self interest

Yes people might suggest that people are motivated for things such as want for sex or money, but behind all of this lies the sole motivation of self interest.

This is a pretty annoying view that I don't particularly like and so I would be happy if anyone could change it 

Edit: Thanks guys you've changed my view

My philosophy teacher held that self-interest was the sole motivation, and like a fool I decided that until I could refute it, I would accept it. I didn't realize how much this has been bothering me. 

The reason why it bothers me, as some have asked, is due to its ruining of my more romantic notions of life and what people are all about. Personally being a christian guy, it also seemed to contrast to my beliefs, suggesting that the kind of life my faith wants people to live was an impossibility of sorts. I now understand how sill this was.

There was no reason for me to accept the argument as valid and sound in the first. It is based off an inductive generalization (it normally seems to be true, therefore it is the case) of small sample size that has no compelling truth behind it. (as /u/caw81 pointed out)

As most people have pointed out and the thing that I had been catching on the most, was the suggestion that sel-sacrifical and selfless acts where somehow purely self-interest in some fashion.

On a more soppy note, I would now contend that (for want of a better word) love is the main motivation behind things. Love of self motivates lots of things such as self interest, but there is something else which I'd been discounting earlier. This is of course love of others which is expressed through selfless actions

Thanks guys

"TL;DR: Nicki Minaj claimed that MTV was biased for not including her video for ""Anaconda"" in the Best Music Video nominees. But they're not sexist, nor racist, Nicki's dancers really aren't ""fat,"" and she hasn't been snubbed completely from the VMA's. Anaconda's been nominated for two other awards. Anaconda isn't that good of a music video, especially compared to the other nominees, and that's ultimately why it wasn't nominated.

For those not in the know, there's been something of a beef between Nicki Minaj and Taylor Swift, wasn't selected because she was black, she didn't feature ""women with very slim bodies,"" or because of the strong female sexuality portrayed. Taylor Swift took a tweet as a personal attack at her, and told her to stop ""pitting women against each other.""

Regardless of whether or not she was aiming criticism at Swift or even Beyoncé (both of whom are nominated for Video of the Year), Nicki Minaj believed she deserved the nomination over one of the other five music videos. Here is a complete list of the VMA nominations this year. Here's each music video nominee:

 Beyoncé - 7/11(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4YRWT_Aldo)
 Ed Sheeran - Thinking Out Loud(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp-EO5I60KA)
 Taylor Swift ft. Kendrick Lamar - Bad Blood(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcIy9NiNbmo)
 Mark Ronson ft. Bruno Mars - Uptown Funk(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPf0YbXqDm0) 
 Kendrick Lamar - Alright(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-48u_uWMHY)

Now here's Anaconda.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZX4ooRsWs)

Here are the claims as to why she didn't get nominated for the award:

1. She's a black woman: She forgets that Beyoncé was nominated as well. One could argue that Beyonce's music video doesn't focus on black women, as her little entourage has much lighter skinned women than her, but so does the Anaconda music video. Kendrick lamar's music video features primarily minority groups, and the few roles reserved for white people are in the place of antagonists (murderous police, for example). Uptown Funk, though mostly men, has Bruno Mars and his minority backup dancers taking up most of the screentime. I think to say there's a racist or sexist bias in the music video selection is ignoring every other nomination.

2. She's not skinny: Nicki Minaj isn't skinny? Tell me one man who would say she's not skinny. Sure, she doesn't have the frame of a clothing model, but she's far from ""fat."" In her own words, ""If your video celebrates women with very slim bodies, you will be nominated for vid of the year."" Kendrick Lamar's music video doesn't focus on women very much at all. Uptown Funk doesn't either. Ed Sheeran's music video only feature's one woman, and in a very monogamous way; if she's being celebrated for anything, it's the dexterity and elegance of her dancing. The women in Beyoncé's music video aren't exactly model frame either. In fact, they're pretty close in stature to Nicki's entourage. The only music video this must be applicable to is Taylor Swift's, but saying that some feature is the path to music video of the year, when only 1 out of the 5 music videos nominated might have it is absurd. I doubt that with skinnier dancers, Anaconda would get any closer to the nomination.

3. Her music video influenced a culture and MTV is purposefully ignoring its popularity: This one is really based on a few different subjective factors, but I wouldn't say Anaconda ""influenced"" a culture, more or less produced that poke fun at the absurdity of the music video and song. None of these things are ""influencing a culture,"" other than giving millions of people a new buzz-generating piece of controversial entertainment. And the music video is popular, and for a period of time, you would hear about it a lot. But at the end of the day, the video was published last August, almost a whole year ago, and has around 489 million views. In 2 months, Bad Blood has garnered over 362 million views. Kendrick's Alright has over 10 million views in 3 weeks. Thinking Out Loud has 662 million views. Uptown Funk reigns supreme with 867 million views. 7/11 is in the same ballpark as Anaconda, being published only 3 months after and only getting 241 million views. But even the most viewed music video on YouTube, Gangnam Style, didn't get nominated at the VMA's the year it came out, nor did the one before it, Justin Bieber's ""Baby."" It's not like the VMA's are snubbing Nicki Minaj altogether; she's been nominated for Best Female Video and Best Hip-Hop Video, a category where she's the only woman represented.

In short, I think the decision to not include Nicki Minaj was on merit alone. MTV hasn't shown a bias against women or minorities, and they're not singling Nicki out on her own by pulling her completely out of the awards. The reason her music video maybe wasn't nominated for the Best Video could be anything. I personally don't think it's worth being called ""Best Music Video of 2015."" Maybe they thought it was too frenetic, goofy, and slightly incoherent to warrant being called the BEST music video. And that's fair for them to do, as the ones who select the nominees.

"We've all heard the saying that a Jack of All Trades is a Master of None.  I'm not here to say that this is completely true and that if you are good at many things you will never be a ""master"" at some skill or aspect of your life.  

What I am willing to argue is that benefits of being a Jack of All Trades far outweighs the benefits of being a master of one or few ""trades"".

For starters, the possibility of finding the thing that truly makes you happy and satisfied in life is lessened quite significantly if your endeavors are honed into a certain subject at an early age.  The amount of time you spend on a certain skill, hobby, or whatever it may be is inversely related on the amount of time you spend on other aspects of your life.  It is my opinion that when you decide on your calling and devote yourself almost entirely to it, you miss out on other precious and interesting opportunities that your life could include otherwise.  

There is no doubt in my mind that abundant success in life is generated by the willingness to make a sacrifices for the thing that you believe that you want the most.  It is up to the individual to decide what matters to them the most.  Personally though, I think this is such a misguided approach to life that often leaves people feeling unfulfilled when they approach an advanced age.  Is ""success"" in life really that valuable to humans that they are willing to give up so much of their time to a specific task?  The need to be recognized and respected as a master of a particular aspect of life is a major driving factor of the sacrifices people make.   

A Jack of All Trades in my opinion does not mean you have to be great or even good at the things that you try once, or even do on a regular basis.  For sanity's sake though, let's just say a Jack of All Trades is ""good"" at many things and a Master is ""great"" at one thing.  When you set your focus on being great at one aspect of your life, there is the potential to backseat so many other important things in your life.  I think, perhaps, this is best explained with an example.  I have a co-worker who is one of the most vocally well-versed, decorated, and revered employees at the company at which I am employed.  I am still quite young, and I just graduated college and he is one of my mentors.  Working with him has really shown me what true mastery looks like.  However, he spends at least 60+ hours a week at work for no real reason other than the fact that he is potentially obsessed with his work.  At his age, I know for a fact he would rather be spending time with his grand kids; he doesn't view time the same way most others do, and as a result ends up leaving the office at 7 o'clock every night.   

I try not to work overtime unless we are really running behind on a project, because while I love my job, I don't feel the need to devote myself fully to the task.  As a result, I am able to focus on so much else and I am not constantly thinking about one specific thing.  The ability to detach myself from my career after I leave the office (or job site) really seems to subconsciously effect the rest of my day.  I feel more energized when I workout and I don't mind studying other things or brushing up on languages other than English.  I also get the opportunity to socialize more with friends when I leave work on time.  Having weekends off means I have the potential to do whatever I want and I can pick up new hobbies along the way.  So in short I am sacrificing the potential to be great at one thing for the potential to be good (or maybe even just experience) many other things.  

Please don't relegate this to being a work-a-holic and not being a work-a-holic.  This was purely a life example that directly relates to the topic at hand.

I am sure it is possible to be a Master of one or more things and still be good at a lot of other things, but my main point is that a Jack of All Trades is a much more interesting and fulfilling approach to life than dedication to a singular practice.         

Edit 
Here is the delta, thanks AnecdotallyExtant

I will change your view with a single diagram.
It will demonstrate that in order to become a master of one, a person must first become a Jack of all.
As an anecdotal example: I am myself somewhere right around the transition between the eighth and ninth picture in that diagram. But I am also the handiest person I know around the house. I can and regularly do fox everything in my house -- nearly worthless with cars, but the home I'm solid.
So again, to become a master of a single trade, one must first become a jack of all. Or one cannot understand his or her own trade out of context. This is why we start our educations in kindergarten and not in graduate studies. A wide, solid, strong and synthetic knowledge base is an absolute a priori necessity.
Which means that it can only follow that a master of one is superior, because it includes a thorough training in the jack of all.

Please read below if you want to see the diagram.  Many others had the same argument, but you approached it from an angle that makes sense.

" Gender does not determine behavior, preference, or inclinations.
 Transgender people are born that way.

I consider myself fairly liberal. I'm in the middle, politically. These two views are actually ones I tend to agree with, but I find them to be in contradiction.

To elaborate:

 Gender does not determine behavior, preference, or inclinations.

I believe that a woman, for instance, was not born to want to nurture. Girls play with barbies because that's what is given to them. And females' roles in society is not ingrained in them. Males aren't all made to hunt, compete, and fight, either.

And I hands down believe that transgender people are born the way they are. Their urges to be the opposite of their birth sex is not something that chose or could choose to ignore. Yet, that can manifest itself in things like wanting to dress up in dresses or grow a beard. And once they transition, many transgender people I see take on traditional, stereotypical roles of their new genders.

So can these two ideas co-exist? I feel they can't, yet I still believe them both equally.

Life is shit. We're all going to die. Most of us are forced to work a 9-5 job we don't enjoy in order to put bread on the table. Over 40% of people in the UK will suffer cancer at some point. 900 million starving people in the world (but thanks to huge inequality and pure dumb luck you're not one of them). Studies have found that most of us would rate ourselves as ""happy"" or ""very happy"", but we're engineered to be overly-optimistic about our lives because an optimistic organism has better inclusive fitness; it is more inclined to ""try, try and try again"" until it breeds. Studies have found people tend to over-estimate the quality of their lives. Most people - even those living in poverty - must lie to themselves and others that their lives are worth living because the alternative would be to either face the cognitive dissonance that arises from continuing a life they believe is not worth continuing, or to kill themselves.
Our lives are devoid of meaning. Most people recognise that life objectively has no meaning, but go down the existentialist route of inventing some subjective bullshit reason to delude themselves that their lives are significant in some way. Some particularly introspective people will eventually come up against the Absurd - recognising the paradox of their being as an individual that desires meaning but finding themselves in a world devoid of any. Zapffe states we try to avoid dealing with this by ""artificially limiting the contents of our consciousness"" using the psychological defensive techniques of distraction, anchoring, isolation and sublimation. Our brains are constantly trying to bullshit ourselves, and for many people it works most of the time, but at times it fails.
""What about the happiness in life?"" What about it? According to Schopenhauer, what we call ""happiness"" is a ""negative"" (i.e. derivative) quantity, a label we attribute to the relative absence of suffering, which is the ""positive"" (i.e. real) element of existence. This is why the pleasures you experience are always less pleasurable than you expect, and the pains always considerably more painful.
Besides, even if you somehow find a true source of happiness, it wouldn't last. If there's one certainty in life beside death, it's the impermanence of all things. This is a truth recognised not only by Schopenhauer but in Buddhism as one of its core principles. It has a special name for the kind of suffering associated with our recognition of this impermanence of the state of affairs: Viparinama-dukkha. You enjoy your life now? In the best case, you're going to grow old and decrepid, and then die. Your significant other is going to die. Your pet cats and dogs are going to die. You'll get sick. You'll get hit by a car. You'll end unemployed. The economy will turn. So the takeaway is that happiness in a world like ours is fleeting at best, non-existent at worst. ""In a world where all is unstable, and nought can endure, but is swept onwards at once in the hurrying whirlpool of change; where a man, if he is to keep erect at all, must always be advancing and moving, like an acrobat on a rope — in such a world, happiness in inconceivable. How can it dwell where, as Plato says, continual Becoming and never Being is the sole form of existence? In the first place, a man never is happy, but spends his whole life in striving after something which he thinks will make him so; he seldom attains his goal, and when he does, it is only to be disappointed; he is mostly shipwrecked in the end, and comes into harbor with masts and rigging gone. And then, it is all one whether he has been happy or miserable; for his life was never anything more than a present moment always vanishing; and now it is over.""
And then we have Professor David Benatar, who explains in Better Never to Have Been that ""a life filled with good and containing only the most minute quantity of bad—a life of utter bliss adulterated only by the pain of a single pin-prick—is worse than no life at all"". He demonstrates that, due to an asymmetry that exists between the values of suffering and happiness when comparing situations that entail a transition from a state of non-existence to existence, every single one of us was overall harmed by being born.
Why do we exist? We're biological machines put together by our constituent genes to serve their interests by acting as vessels through which they can proliferate while having a measure of protection from their environment and the machines of competitor genes. We're engineered, like all life, to survive and breed effectively within our environments. It in the interest of these genes to wire our brains to believe our lives are meaningful and worth continuing however bullshit this might be because pessimists and nihilists tend to be far less inclined to survive and reproduce.
""Wretched, ephemeral race, children of chance and tribulation, why do you force me to tell you the very thing which it would be most profitable for you not to hear?

However, the second best thing for you is: to die soon."" -- Aristotle, The Wisdom of Silenus","{'he', 'him', 'man', 'his'}"
"So, every time I see people defend Obamacare, they point out that companies having to accept people with pre-existing conditions is a major benefit. Maybe I'm missing something here, and I hope you guys can help change my mind.

So, in my view, corporations don't actually have to care about anyone. All they care about is money. They are businesses, they exist to make a profit. Absolutely nobody should be surprised by this. They don't have a moral obligation to help anybody or be compassionate or think of the children or any of that stuff. Businesses don't have a heart, just two columns of numbers.

Insurance companies only exist to make money. The way they do that is by investing in different people, at different rates, to end up making more money than they spend. The perfect customer from their perspective is one who pays their bill every month and never gets sick or costs them money. The worst customer is one who is constantly sick and costs them a ton of money.

So when a young, smart, healthy, middle class person comes in for insurance, he's probably a good investment. Odds are, he will make his payments, and probably not develop any serious issues. A safe bet.

Now you have an obese smoker with asthma, poor eyesight, a heart murmur, epilepsy, diabetes, and leprosy, and he wants insurance. Guess what pal? You are a terrible investment! The odds of you earning the company more money than you cost is almost zero. He's a terrible bet and no sane employee should even consider giving this person insurance.

I understand this means these people can't get insurance, but that's not the companies problem. If the government wants to step in an insure people with poor health, that's fine, but I don't see why they should force insurance companies to make bad investments.

"I'm sure most people on here have seen The Donald's comments about John McCain's military service.  I don't know if a lot of people are aware what John McCain said before that.

(Here's an article

Here's a picture from the rally.  That is a standing room only crowd.  There may not be thousands there like some have said, but there are certainly hundreds and likely over 1,000 people there to show their support a full 6 months before the first primary and over 7 months before the Arizona primary.

After Trump had a rally in Phoenix, AZ (the state McCain represents) for a standing room only crowd, John McCain (while sitting in the senate office he was sent to by the voters of Arizona) said to a reporter for the New Yorker, ""This performance with our friend out in Phoenix is very hurtful to me, because what he did was he fired up the crazies.”  

That is a sitting senator denigrating the people of his own state for going to a rally for a Presidential candidate from his own party.  These are just regular people participating in democracy, and getting mocked by their own elected representative.

What Trump said about POWs and the military was clearly out of line, but isn't nearly as repugnant as McCain saying that about thousands of American citizens that he represents.

Trump is awful.  Just awful.  He's a mockery and making a sham of our election process.  He should be polling at under 1%.  

But I don't get to make those decisions, and John McCain sure as fuck doesn't get to either.  The Republican base is showing their support for Trump, and for John McCain to dismiss that by calling HIS OWN CONSTITUENTS ""the crazies"" is far worse than what Trump said about McCain.

"Hello! I recently saw a CMV on an argument of the probability of the existence of God or Extraterrestial Life. I had posted a comment but no one has replied so I figured I would post my own CMV. Basically I am relating science and religion.


There is a statistical basis for God that gives an absolute definition for God's existence and that can be explained through statistical thermodynamics and entropy. Thermodynamics is a powerful science that is deeply underrated because it has evolved into the science of defining what is possible and impossible.


I will try to explain entropy to the best of my ability but it requires a fundamental knowledge of the Laws of Thermodynamics. But the Second Law states that the entropy of the universe must always increase for any (natural) irreversible process (or be equal to zero for processes at equilibrium). I claim these irreversible processes ""natural"" simply because they exist in nature without any perturbation of an outside intelligent force. But the proper scientific term would be ""isolated"" when referring to the system in question. Now entropy is defined as the ""measure of randomness or disorder"". This concept is hard to grasp because it requires the definition of two terms ""macrostates"" and ""microstates"".


The best way for one to explain this is through the statistics of dice. There are 11 possible outcomes once rolled (2-12) and these represent the macrostates. However there are many ways to represent a set of the numbers (or macrostate), say macrostate(5) = 1+4....2+3...3+2...4+1 (assuming distinguishable dice). Now each set of the dice outcome (1+4 or 2+3...etc) represents a microstate. Now if we rolled the dice infinite times what would the results look like? A perfect bell curve right? With 7 the highest and 2/12 the lowest. Why is this? because 7 has the highest number of possibilities (or microstates) (1+6...2+5...3+4...etc) and 2 or 12 have the lowest (1+1 or 6+6, respectively). Thus the Second Law can be defined that ""An isolated system tends toward an equilibrium macrostate with maximum entropy, because then the number of microstates is the largest and this state is statistically most probable."" This matches with physical observations. Think of an ice in a perfect crystal lattice where all the atoms are arranged in a lattice becomes in a thermal equilibrium with the environment. It begins to melt and move around increasing the possible arrangements in the liquid state. The atomic arrangement increases and therefore the entropy of the system is increasing as the water changes states. (similar argument for liquid to gas).


There is an argument that entropy can be a viable definition for the passage of time because any spontaneous process goes from an ordered state to a more disordered state. In other words, one with more macrostates and possible outcomes. In the case of the previous examples, before you roll the dice, there exists only one microstate, where there is no value of the dice right? (because you haven't rolled it duh) Then you roll the dice and open up the possibilities. Therefore the process goes from holding the dice in your hand with only one state (ordered) to actually rolling it opening up 36 possibilities (more disorder). Same with transfer of thermal energy from the hotter (or possesses more thermal energy) environment to the ice for it to melt. Energy cannot transfer from the ice to the environment because the ice possesses less potential energy. Heat always flows from hot to cold. Never the reverse.


Now what does this have to do with God? Well imagine the entire passage of time of the universe, where the universe is always increasing entropy (i.e. going from order to disorder). Now imagine going back in time, where things go from disorder to order (dice go in your hand or reverse heat flow from ice to environment). Reverse time in your head all the way to the Big Bang, where there can only exist ONE PERFECT STATE and that is God. The whole universe and everything in physical existence in one perfectly ordered state and that is God. That is the basis of God being omnipotent because he is literally everything and in everywhere. Then there was a Big Bang and the Universe was created (compare to Genesis 1 in the Bible). The ""Universe Clock"" started and the perfect state proceeded towards a more disordered state.


Thinking of this thermodynamically, God is the unnatural action of going from disorder to order. Therefore, God is order. God is considered ""supernatural"" because he is a force different than that in the physical world where entropy is violated. Now, the Bible claimed that ""God created life"" and this can be proven true. Life is a statistically improbable result from physics. But it arose from a perfect condition and arrangement of molecules that somehow produced an well-ordered organism. (There is a theory that Earth before all life was basically a barren wasteland of gasses and electric storms which the lightning produced enough energy for the gasses to arrange perfectly and organized perfectly). Statistically speaking, life shouldn't even exist because it is ordered perfectly that it is extremely improbable. The example my physical chemistry professor gave is that if you gave a monkey a type writer and trained it to punch a bunch of random letters, what is the probability that it will type out the whole entire encyclopaedia? However, I do not disagree with the possibility that other life (aliens or whatever) exists because there is always a possibility (The Black Swan Theory) but we might as well have a better chance with monkeys and typewriters. Also I have found a paper in which relates the origins of life and entropy: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.06988v1.pdf


Also, the Bible claimed that ""God created man under the image of himself"". This shouldn't be taken literally because we don't ACTUALLY look like God but the original interpretation is that we are, in some ways, Godlike. I say this because we do things that are against entropy because we have intelligence. Well actually all life has some degree of intelligence but there are levels. The most fundamental act against entropy that all life possess is that life exists and strive to continue to exist. We (as in all life, plants, animals, cells, humans...) are highly ordered structures that are the result of disorder becoming ordered and we continue to exist! Not only do we continue to exist but it is a biological concern for us to continue living and reproduce. Merely producing babies or more life is an act against entropy because we are continuing to make more ordered structures. The thing that separates humans from the rest of life is that we have a higher level of intelligence in that we are smart enough to interact with the environment and one another to a higher degree. Think about this, if there was a bunch of random metals laying on the Earth, what is the probability that it will become the Eiffel Tower? That required the work of man. Paraphrasing the Bible again (sorry just justifying Christians and Catholics) ""God made man the rulers of His creation"" We are the masters of craft, creating wonderful structures and arts. We created civilizations which are highly ordered organizations. This is what people meant when they said math is the language of God and engineers are craftsman of God. They create ordered things which require a level of intelligence that is parallel to God.
However, we still need to keep entropy in mind. The entropy of the universe must go from order to disorder but it can be broken up into two parts: the entropy of a system in question and the entropy of everything else or surroundings. If we create something whether it be a building, a computer or whatever, we are making a higher ordered system but we are still increase the disorder of the universe by opening up more possibilities. Buildings allow more physical space for the rest of the environment to use or computers open up more possibilities (faster chips, software, internet).

"I anticipate that this is going to either be down-voted to oblivion or that people are going to try and go off on rants about the wider issue of harm that is caused to children by sexual abuse. I would greatly appreciate if you would take the time to read the following points before commenting or down-voting.

I am not attempting to diminish the harm suffered by children who are victims of sexual abuse. I accept that children are victimised by the perpetrator of their abuse when the images are created and again when and if they find out that images of their abuse are being viewed. 

My view is based solely on the idea that the causal link between the act (viewing the image) and the harm (the victim being re-victimised) is broken in these circumstances, and that it is impossible to therefore attribute this harm to the person who views the image.

There is, on the other hand, grounds to argue that a person who actively views and re-distributes child porn is liable for the harm suffered by the victim. 

Each and every person who shares an image of a child being abused with another person, is ultimately responsible for the image remaining in circulation. Therefore, if a victim of child abuse learns that images of their abuse is being viewed online, then every person after the creator of the image is responsible for that image still existing, since they have created copies and re-distributed them.

Someone who has viewed the image (so downloaded it) but not re-distributed it, cannot be said to be responsible for the fact the image existed when they found it, or that it continues to exist after they downloaded it. Unless the person viewing the image pays to view it or offers a person some sort of benefit in kind other than money, such as for example praise, then him being a passive consumer has, in my opinion, absolutely no impact on the existence of the image on a distribution network. 

A person who views an image of child abuse is only responsible for their behaviour and not the behaviour of others who might view and distribute the same image. A good test of whether harm is caused by a passive consumer of child pornography is to take that passive consumer out of the equation and assess whether the same amount of harm is suffered by the victim. Since passive viewing does not impact upon the existence of the image, if you were able to stop every person who ever passively views but does not re-distribute an image, the image would still exist. The number of people viewing and re-distributing the images would still be the same and they would all still be liable for the harm if the victim in the image was to find out that images of their abuse were being viewed. 

Please don't try and change my view by telling me how bad child porn is, I don't need to be told. My view could quite as easily be about any other topic, except that this appears to me to be the only case where harm is often attributed even though the causal link is broken.

"The general consensus with frame rates greater than 24 or 30 fps in live action work is that it sucks. The illusion of a flickery alternate world breaks down when the motion is as smooth as reality. The viewer more readily perceives actors in makeup on sets. It all just looks... fake. Any film in HFR, either filmed at 48 or interpolated on a TV, looks like a cheap soap opera.

I recently bought a PS4. GTA V looks WORSE than it did on the PS3. The draw distance is better, there are less pop-ins, but the frame rate is too high. Everything looks smooth and fake and video gamey. Flying over the city reminds me of playing N64, because I can't see Los Santos. I just see a bunch of polygons and textures and shaders. Actors in makeup on sets. EDIT: GTA5 runs at 30fps on PS4. Why does it look worse? Why does it feel more fake? Is the falseness of everything just... clearer?

I just wish there was a way to limit the frame rate to 24 or 30. It would look fantastic.

But I keep hearing people say they NEED 60fps! I don't know why this is but I have some guesses:

1. Gamers want that hyper reality. Video games and live action film are two completely different mediums, so games are expected to (or at least allowed to) look different. There is something about that false smoothness that is appealing to a gamer. It makes something look ""video gamey"".

2. Is it more of a PC thing? As a way to show off? A high frame rate means the computer is powerful/expensive. It gives the user a feeling that their machine is worth the money? I don't know.

3. It increases gamer performance? Does it have something to do with getting the slightest advantage when playing other people? Do gamers with the highest refresh rates perform better? Does getting the most headshots mean more than enjoying an immersive experience?

I suppose that's the sticking point: immersion. A high frame rate does not immerse me in a video game. It does the opposite.

(NB This is my view of games on a rectangular screen; I've never tried a modern VR like Oculus. HFR is probably critical with that.)",{'actors'}

I think men are more competitive and aggressive by nature, because we have more testosterone. I think women are more gentle and nourishing by nature, because they have more estrogen.

I also think that gay people probably won't be fulfilling those two roles in future generations, thus increasing the chance of new gay people emerging from new families.

I'm not sure if that's good or bad. I think the average gay couple will have fewer children than straight couples, which is great considering there's like 7 billion of us already. Then again, I think gay children will have more trouble in their lives for a few more decades (even more in conservative societies).

"This CMV post is partly inspired by this r/relationships post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3e4h7z/i_m38_want_to_surrender_our_severely_autistic_son/) I came across earlier today. This is also a topic I feel somewhat strongly about and I have not had a chance to really share my view on because it's sort of a ""taboo"" view to have.

To sum up the r/relationships post: OP's 4 year old son is severely autistic and OP has been told by doctors that his son will never function above the level of a 1 year old and will require constant care. Son is ruining OP's life and marriage, and is negatively affecting OP's 2 young daughters as well.

I do not believe the OP of that post, and the many other parents who are in a similar scenario, deserve to have their lives ruined just because they were ""dealt a bad hand"" and ended up with a disabled child. I think that euthanasia is a humane, simple solution to a problem like this. After all, we euthanize our loved cats and dogs that are no longer able to have a good, independent life. I don't see a fundamental difference between the two cases.

As for government-owned care facilities: I don't believe it is a good use of our resources as a society to continue to take care of individuals who have no chance to ever become functional members of society. Euthanasia is a much more economically and environmentally more efficient option.

What won't change my view: slippery slope/""where do we draw the line"" types of arguments. We are only discussing cases in which the child is beyond a shadow of a doubt unable to ever function independently. CMV.

Edit: I'm deeply sorry if I offended anybody, particularly those with autism/other disabilities, with this post. Please understand that I am not suggesting that anyone with autism be euthanized. My argument only applied to those who were not capable of basically doing anything besides eating, sleeping, and using the bathroom (with assistance). Anyone who is reading this post is FAR from even close to the level I'm talking about.

"It seems like the general consensus is that the present is more progressive and accepting compared to say 50 years ago. While when it comes to laws I would agree but when it comes to society I am shaking my head at that statement.

A lot of times it's been a conversation opener at a bus station like for an example someone saying ""those damn Chinese are ruining the city"" and my friend who works at a cafe had one customer say ""I am glad to be served by a white person"" her being part-native and the fact that a Filipino woman also works at the cafe, told him to get the fuck out.

These aren't the only examples I have but those stood out to me the most.

While I am aware that the past was no walk in the park, even though we no longer have residential schools, back of bus laws, or allowed to refuse service or employment on the basis of ethnicity without getting sued for it, and in most countries concentration camps. Many people seem to wish those were still happening, they still think their lesser people, think the world is better off without them and shun them like a leper.   

I am a 29 year old white woman born and raised in Canada, a country that is supposedly the most tolerant of other races and cultures, if that's the case I can't help but wonder how bad it is in other countries. Even though I am from a small town I have seen racism in major cities too and I have traveled in Europe and at least a lot of people I've talked to complained about gypsies and immigrants. I don't even think it's an age thing since I've seen this in both the young (one 18 year old who thinks the natives are lying about residential schools) and the old (my friend thinks the most racist people are old people, who I've heard at least half the comments from).

I want to believe that we have come a long way towards race relations but I just don't see it.

"I'm going to try to attack this issue from multiple angles and I want to preface by saying that I am NOT trying in any way to attack the transgender community. 




-First off, I want to begin by discussing the very premise of labeling oneself as trans. I have an issue with transgender people saying that they are born with a gendered brain in a wrong gendered body. For many years women have been fighting for equality with men and in this light it is abhorrent to say that men and women have brains that are different. Feminists (both men and women) have fought hard to erase the entrenched beliefs of a patriarchal society. For example, to be a male yet be interested in feminine things and FEEL feminine is only upholding the belief that there are certain traits unique to and can only be possessed by females. This is the premise to my argument so bear with me. 



Alas, as stated above, I believe that being transgender can be one's own way (subconsciously) to mentally rebel against society's very deep and entrenched gender roles. 



-Secondly, I see thoughts of transgender individuals to be patterned similarly to the thoughts of individuals with the mental illness known as body dysmorphic disorder. Persons with BDD tend to have an obsession with a certain part of their body or facet of their personality that they blow out of proportion to reality. This obsession causes sufferers a great deal of emotional pain and can lead them to take extreme measures to remedy the perceived problem. Most people with BDD are adolescents. 

For example, someone with BDD may be so obsessed with the shape of their nose that they seek surgery to reduce their concern and obsession. However, surgery is not a treatment for BDD. BDD is a manifestation of extreme anxiety and depression and fixing the obsession does not remove said mental illnesses from the person. Most individuals who do go to extreme measures as such tend to continue experience the anxiety and depression that manifested itself as an obsession with the shape of their nose.


-Now, in that vein how are we to say that the plight of transgender people is any different? Feelings of extreme anxiety and depression directed at the person's gender, correction of gender and not a lot of resolution with the underlying mental illness.


See this study: Long-Term Follow-Up of Transsexual Persons Undergoing Sex Reassignment Surgery: Cohort Study in Sweden. Research has shown that ""Persons with transsexualism, after sex reassignment, have considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behaviour, and psychiatric morbidity than the general population. Our findings suggest that sex reassignment, although alleviating gender dysphoria, may not suffice as treatment for transsexualism, and should inspire improved psychiatric and somatic care after sex reassignment for this patient group.""

My primary reason for believing that Bernie Sanders is at least as electable in the general as Hillary Clinton (I actually think he's more electable, but that's immaterial to this CMV) is a set of thought experiments, which simply revolve around considering the behavior of individuals/groups voting (or abstaining) in 2008/2012, how that behavior would respond to Hillary being the nominee, and how that response would be altered by having Bernie as the nominee instead. For ease of illustration, I'm going to use Jeb Bush as the stand-in/proxy for the eventual Republican presidential nominee - if you think the GOP will likely nominate someone else, and it will make a difference in how a significant number of people vote (or abstain), feel free to specify why/how in your reply, and then proceed within the context of your chosen Republican presidential nominee.

-----

So, here are some examples of the general form of the thought experiment - this set of examples is, by no means, comprehensive, but I've yet to think of one which significantly advantages Hillary over Bernie:

  Describe to me the person or demographic, who voted for Obama in 2012, who would vote for Hillary over Jeb in 2016, but who would vote for Jeb over Bernie in 2016. (Impacts: Swing votes)
 
   Now describe to me the opposite group (BernieJebHillary) - which group seems larger?

  Describe to me the apathetic Democrat who, once they are familiar with Bernie as a candidate, is more energized by Hillary than Bernie. (Impacts: Democrat turnout, i.e. harmful abstentions)
 
   Now describe to me the opposite group - which seems larger?

  Describe to me the Republican who would make it to the polls to vote against Bernie, but would be like ""meh, fuck it"" and not bother to vote against Hillary. (Impacts: Republican turnout, i.e. helpful abstentions)

-----

Now, outside of that form of argument, one thing I've seen cited as evidence against Bernie in this respect is a particular Gallup poll, regarding attitudes towards those who identify as socialist:

For years, Gallup's been asking the following question: ""If your party nominated a generally well-qualified person for president who happened to be X, would you vote for that person?"" 

In the most recent iteration of that (from June 2-7), respondents were least likely to say yes when ""X"" was ""socialist"".

My problem with that is as follows:

Every one of those descriptors, except for socialist, is a largely apolitical identity - whereas being ""a socialist"" is a political ideology.

The phrase ""just happened to be black/Muslim/Jewish/a woman"" implies that the nominee would have said identity, but would still mostly follow the tenets of whatever ""your party"" was - whereas ""just happened to be a socialist"" implies an ideological leaning that potentially conflicts with whatever you feel ""your party"" stands for.

Therefore, comparing the numbers for ""a socialist"" to all those other identity-based descriptors, without also including numbers for ""a conservative"" and ""a liberal"" simply doesn't provide a useful context in which to interpret the numbers for ""a socialist"".

I also think that, due to the way the question is asked, the poll winds up seriously underestimating the impact of strategic voting (i.e. voting for the candidate with the best chance of beating your least preferred candidate) against the GOP - I think it's just plain ludicrous to suggest that 41% of Democrats would prefer Jeb Bush to Bernie Sanders, simply because of the socialist label, but maybe I'm wrong on that point?

-----

Another argument is that the GOP media machine will be able to use the socialist label to get their base frothing at the mouth and drive turnout (this relates to the 3rd example thought experiment).

My feeling here is that, considering that has been Fox news' sole purpose for the last 8 years, they are already well beyond the point of diminishing returns - there is no part of the base, who is amenable to this sort of strategy, who isn't already frothing at the mouth, socialist or no - trying to use the socialist label to wring even more turnout from their base, at this point, is trying to squeeze blood from a stone.

-----

Finally, while the GOP's fear/anger-based strategy for motivating turnout is a finely-tuned machine at this point, turnout among Democrats is much more variable - so many on the left feel entirely apathetic towards the party, so turnout is unreliable.

I will admit, I don't even know exactly why, but Hillary seems to personify what people on the left are apathetic towards - nobody, nobody I've talked to, on Reddit or IRL, seems excited about Hillary. On the other hand, among those who have become familiar with Bernie as a candidate, he seems to energize people in a way that I've simply seen no recent evidence of any other potential candidate even coming close to.

Since voter-apathy seems to be a fairly huge problem on the left (relative to the right, at least) this seems like a huge point in Bernie's favor - especially because it could also have a fairly significant impact on Congressional races.

-----

One last thing: I know the socialist label is a big part of this discussion, but I don't want it to devolve into an exclusive focus on that - I am interested in how Bernie stacks up against Hillary, so if you are going to talk about how people respond to the socialist label, please keep it in the context of a comparison with how people respond to Hillary as a political fixture.",{'he'}
"I've seen quite a bit in recent years on social media, TV, and other mediums, an attempt to bring up the self-esteem of many people, most notably of which is probably young women.  The idea is fantastic, but the methodology is misguided.

The problem we have faced in the past is a woman's worth being tied directly to her physical attractiveness.  If a woman was physically beautiful, she was desirable, regardless of intelligence, personality, work ethic, values, etc.  Of course, I'm over simplifying just a bit, but we're all aware of the problem.

Fast forward to recent years, and we have lots of groups attempting to combat the problem of physical attractiveness being a woman's value, but this is off base.  They attempt to solve the problem by redefining beauty.  They try to convince young ladies that everyone is beautiful, that curves (fat) are beautiful, that acne is beautiful, that being flat-chested is beautiful, etc.  Of course, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but when you were to approach it from a statistical view, it is obvious that certain traits are generally more desirable than others.  This is why most professional models are tall, have small waists, have angular facial features, small noses, full lips, large breasts, long arms, long fingers, long legs proportionally.

What is largely ignored by social campaigns that, in some ways, demonize beauty, is the idea of acceptance.  Girls and guys are not taught to accept that they were dealt a certain set of cards for life.  You can take care of your body, work out, eat healthy, etc, to get the most out of what you've been given, but young people are not generally taught to accept that they are who they are and they have certain limitations to live within.  If you're short, frumpy, have a big nose, acne, or whatever, I believe it's better to teach people to accept who you are.  It reminds me of a line from ""The Incredibles"" that made perfect sense.  Yes, I'm referencing a child's movie, but that doesn't mean it isn't valid.  The main bad guy is Syndrome, and part of his sinister plot is to give everyone super powers because, ""When everyone is super, no one will be.""

Much in the same way, if everyone is beautiful, then nobody is beautiful.

For guys, a possible equivalent to a female's beauty is a man's athleticism.  However, it doesn't seem that guy's are taught to be fooled into thinking everyone is athletic.  Because beauty is more subjective, it is more difficult to quantify, but with athleticism, no one would try to tell me I'm just as athletic as Anthony Davis to make me feel better.  They'd tell me he's a special athlete, and I need to accept I'll never be a professional athlete, and I need to not tie my worth to my athleticism.

"On July 16, 2015, a gunman opened fire on two military installations in Chattanooga, Tennessee, killing four service members immediately. Two other service members and a police officer were wounded, with one of the servicemen dying from his injuries two days later. The gunman, Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez, was killed by police at the site of the second shooting.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Chattanooga_shootings)

I feel terrible for the families of the victims of these attacks, but to me, this was an attack on soldiers at a military target.  The US military today is able to conduct war through drone strikes from across the planet.  The attacks weren't on traditional war targets, but the US blows up enemy training grounds and recruiting sites all the time.  We don't consider those attacks terrorist attacks, we consider them strikes on legitimate military targets that weaken our enemy.  I think it's naive and arrogant to arrogant to think an American drone strike on a Taliban recruiting ground is a legitimate act of war and that an attack on an American recruiting ground is a terrorist attack.  

I'm not trying to justify his actions or his beliefs, I'm more sayitg that Terrorist Attacks in my opinion are unjustifiable strikes against non-combatants, they are war crimes, they are despicable and criminal, but that the Chattanooga attacks were something different.  The perpetrator is still our enemy, but we shouldn't demonize him as a terrorist.

"I think that Transpeople for the most part are either 1) chemically imbalanced, which can be easily treated through medication, or 2) just have a poor grasp on what it means to be a man/woman. 

Being a man/woman isn't about conforming to traditional views of masculinity or femininity, it's about being an adult versus a child. The same thing with trianary genders systems, the people claiming them are just subscribing to old school/sexist ideas about what a man or a woman feels like, and because they don't feel like that, are pretending to be something else. 


Not all women are going to feel like the traditional ""feminine"" stereotype, but that doesn't mean they aren't a woman, it just means they are saying that what defines a woman is how they differ from men and vice versa, instead of the less sexist idea that what defines a woman is how she is different than a child and what makes a man is how he differs from a boy. 


TL;DR: What makes a man is how he differs from a boy, not how he differs from a woman. Trans/trianary gendered people are instead subscribing to sexist view that what makes a man is how differs from a woman.

"I mainly want to challange socialists / communists and libertarians. 

I think that the sole proposal of a economic Idea is pointless in our current world.
There is the socialist approach that would lead to a non competitive environment like in the eastern sector during the cold war. This approach fails when the state has too many payments for salary because the public sector is massivly overstaffed.
A good example is Greece. Furthermore does socialism encourage corruption of officials.
If there is no private interst in consumption of goods no economy can prosper. ( I dont mean grow irresponsible but develop to a certain degree)
Similarly the Idea of a basic income while the majority of people is still part of the workforce is just mind boggling.

The other extreme is Libertarianism.
I know there are modest versions like with socialism. But:
proposals like: cut all taxes, no regulation at all are just utter nonsense. In the current world we live in I dont see any chances for a fair market not governed by basic rules and regulations.
I can understand where the desire for freedom for the individual comes from but I fail to recognize the usefullness for society. When the state has no income it cannot guarantee basic services like water and electicity and the internet. Which would make the idea of ""net neutrality"" invalid. The best interest of this idea would oppose the best interst for all recipients of the impact of the change.

as /u/_stonecoldsaidso pointed out about a month ago.
When the Free Market fails to account for negative externalities, regulation is appropriate.

And I agree with his idea. Uncontrolled markets can exist as long as there is no impact on other areas of concern.
And I dont see how libertarianism would deal with this issue especially when impacts on the function of the internet and other basic ""public goods"" can disrupt entire economies and even countries.

There might me additional ideologies.

"So I've been reading a bit of Foucault lately (certainly not a lot, so I don't claim to be an expert). As such, he has influenced my views on gay marriage... and issue is used to support. I now see the gay community's fight for marriage rights as simply fighting for justice and rights as defined by the very people that oppressed them. Therefore I see marriage itself as a tool of social oppression and normalization.

I would compare it to the end of slavery in the United States. ""Marriage equality"" as we have it now would be like if at the end of the Civil War, instead of abolishing slavery, Congress simply passed an amendment that said that ""black people can now ALSO own slaves.""

"Revulsion. Disgust. Anger. Resentment. Spitefulness. 

Most humans would associate these responses alongside mass displays of torture or killing. Perhaps such a countenance would be most appropriately donned whilst becoming informed of the latest school shooting. There are many permissible circumstances in which one would be justified to feel such repulsion. 

This is what I feel when discussing women's issues. 

Throughout my young adult life, I have always sought out knowledge which furthered the distance between my personal beliefs and my upbringing. As a son of a son of a sharecropper from southern Mississippi, I was raised with fundamentalist Christian, neo-conservative paradigms.
Yet, for some reason, while the aforementioned constructs were so easily eliminated from my reality... Even the flurry of knowledge and humanity which spurned such personal renaissance was futile in this regard as I have trouble even acknowledging the women's rights movements as anything more meaningful than tabloid journalism. 

If I were to be 100% honest, I can honestly say that I've never seen racism in the corporate world. Yet sexism does abound. I work in Network Security, one of the most male-dominated fields known to exist within corporate boundaries. Many women have spoken out about this, but I can confirm it is similar in experience to the way this blogger has put it . 
I have worked under superiors who have outright stated their unwillingness to employ females, especially on male-dominated teams. I have seen a group of men conspire against a female counterpart in pursuit of righting perceived wrongs. 

In my few short attempts to annihilate this final bastion of uneducated ignorance, (which, admittedly, has been expressed and interpreted as sexism) I have failed miserably. When the fallacies which seem to form the battle-cry for many associated with feminist movements (70% Statistic are seemingly ignored, it is very hard to empathize.

But today I received the inspiration behind this urgent desire for comprehension: 

I was offered the position of a lifetime on the basis that the only other candidate in serious consideration, a female, wouldn't be quite capable of dealing with the ""stresses of the environment"". That was the official response I was given by my new supervisor... But while I've only been with the company for 6 months, she has been in her position for 4 years. Same department. No movement. 

The guys make fun of her constantly. She makes it easy.
We use a chatroom/voting app online to determine where we go to lunch everyday. I was invited to it the first day of my employment, when I was treated to lunch. She discovered it about a month ago, when I spilled the beans by accident. 
When the guys at lunch found out, they told me she would ""ruin the fun"" and joked that there ""isn't a way to value an account as .7 a vote"". 

I laughed at the jokes and agreed with the remarks. This is my comfort zone. 

But when she handed in her resignation this morning upon hearing the decision, I couldn't help but feel a little bit guilty. 

For her coworkers, who viewed her as an unforgiving political stalwart, it was a victory. For her boss, who she had reported to HR twice for sexual harassment/discrimination, it was a monumental occasion. 

""(He) had been trying to figure out how to fire her since (he) had been hired."" he expounded at lunch today. 

But when I stopped by her office this morning and saw the trash bin full of Kleenex alongside the two workplace 'awards' she had been given... it was difficult. Her eyes spelled defeat... deep. Not the kind that you come back from. The kind that comes from a life of perceived failure.  

The group voted to go to a wings bar and drink in celebration. I was toasted as the ""man who killed the witch."" I smiled, but for the first time in my life I am feeling as though I must begin to confront my denial and willful ignorance. 

Thus, I am here. Not completely by my own conscious will, but instead driven by a subconscious desire and need for justice. While I can't make things right at work, I am in a position now of senior executive leadership, the youngest to don such a title in the history of the firm. I sit at the head of a department of one of the largest financial firms in the country. I can start making a difference.

The problem I have is that I don't believe you. Even with the abhorrent anecdotal experiences I could cite, I haven't seen a shred of empirical evidence which shows this is anything outside of a few small circles. In fact, I can easily rationalize away my experiences with only a slight bit of denial.

But that would be easy. I already won a position I shouldn't have had the easy way. While I despise winning that way, business is business and the world keeps spinning. What I don't wish to do, however, is conduct myself in a manner in which I disadvantage my female counterparts, be they potential employees or individuals I encounter throughout my career. But I fear that my personal beliefs have a large potential for negating those altruistic ideals. 

When Ellen Pao resigned from the firm, it was apparent to everyone with connections inside the industry that she was scapegoated. It was so well-known that publishers have been forced to address this directly. 

I fit the median demographic for Reddit dead-center. I despised Pao. I degrade feminists. I am sexist, but consider myself left-leaning.

I am ready to change that. But everywhere I look, on every feminist site, I only see whining and complaining. No studies. No empirical evidence. Just feel-good baby food seemingly written for an emotional, illogical audience. This is how I view women's rights activists. 

Help me change. Please...

"Taking the existence of super-powered aliens as a given, I think the most unrealistic part of Man of Steel was Superman standing any chance against Zod.

Zod was basically trained from birth to be the ultimate killer.  He was the product of generations of eugenics to create the perfect fighter.  He was his people's greatest military commander.  

Superman was physically stronger than the average person of his race for having grown up in the ""nutrient-rich environment"" of Earth.  But he grew up on a farm and received no formal training.  He had only barely started to have a mastery of his abilities by the time Zod and his followers arrived.  

Zod and his people were initially shocked by their newfound strength on Earth, but they quickly adapted.  He achieved a similar power level to Superman in a matter of days, in addition to his previous training and skills.  The advantage in sheer strength of Superman should not have been enough to overpower Zod.  It is basically like putting a Navy Seal against a body-builder.  The body-builder may be physically stronger, but he's still going to get his ass kicked. 

EDIT:  

Okay, a variety of points have been made which have collectively CMV:

 Zod's talents as a military leader were never explicitly about his personal fighting prowess.  He also loses in single combat to Jor-El.
 Even if Zod were a better fighter and quickly adapted to his new strength on Earth, he was still out of his element and had not committed to ""muscle-memory"" things that were now second-nature to Superman. 
 Superman's true power is that he is always as strong as the plot needs him to be, rendering the possibility of failure moot.  Plot armor OP.
 Ultimately any fight between opponents of similar enough power can end in an upset, and Superman beating Zod may be an example of that.

"Two weeks ago, I thought Donald Trump had the biggest joke of a campaign. I didn't think anyone could take him seriously. I assumed if there were people at his campaign speeches it is because they were paid to be there. I was solidly behind Bernie Sanders. 

Now I am not so sure. To be clear, I still think the most important issues are the ones Bernie Sanders talks about but I think Donald Trump will be better at solving these issues. 

Here are the issues that I think are important to this country: 

1. Growing rift between the rich and the poor and the weakening middle class

2. Political corruption - politicians make decisions based on who pays for their campaign rather than for the good of the voters

3. National security threats like ISIS

4. Imprisonment of victimless crimes like possession of marijuana

5. The trillion dollar national debt

I used to think gay rights and healthcare were big concerns but I think President Obama has done a good job of solving these. 

1. Of these five issues, I think the weakening middle class is the biggest issue and this is where I think Donald Trump beats Bernie Sanders. I think the middle class has been shrinking not because people aren't working but because there aren't high paying jobs. Yes, part of this is because the CEO's of these companies are making 300x what the lowest paid employee makes and this is where I see Bernie Sanders being effective. However, I think the much greater issue is the fact that a lot of our high paying jobs have went overseas because of bad trade deals. For example, Donald Trump mentioned Ford building a 2 billion dollar manufacturing plant in Mexico right now. If we had higher taxes on imported cars then Ford would be forced to build that factory here. Everyone knows most of our manufacturing happens overseas and this needs to happen here. When manufacturing happened in the U.S. that is when the middle class was strongest. I remember one TIL saying that the average salary for a household in today's wages in the 1950s was $55,000. And that was with one individual in the household working, whereas today normally both people have to work. I think Donald Trump would be an incredible negotiator and make deals for the United States that help bring back high paying jobs. 

2. Political corruption - Bernie Sander's record is flawless and I think because of Donald Trump's great wealth, no one could pay him off. Also, while most politicians make money from the increased attention they receive from campaigning, Donald Trump has already lost money from his campaign due to sponsorship deals like Macy's falling through and NBC's Miss America Pageant being canceled. 

3. National Security - I have not heard an effective strategy for dealing with ISIS until I heard something Donald Trump said. He wants to deprive them of their wealth. ISIS is making a killing from selling oil. Donald Trump said he would bomb the oil fields then make a protective ring around the oil and have companies rebuild the oil fields. Now, this is pretty aggressive behavior. Not too much different than what Putin did with Crimea. However, it's a great deal for the American people. We get cheap oil, we are not nation building, and ISIS gets drained of money and can't buy weapons, can't pay soldiers, and can't continue their operations. I hate seeing these wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from a selfish perspective because they cost trillions of dollars. We send billions of dollars removing a horrific dictator, yet we get no thanks. Many Iraqis hate us and they are not paying back any of the money it cost us to help them. I think Donald Trump will make us more secure and could save us billions on national security. 

4. Imprisonment of victimless crimes - without a doubt Bernie Sanders would be better at this. I don't see Donald Trump removing harsh sentences anytime soon. 

5. The national debt - Yes, a lot of this is owed to American citizens and the government gets a deal because interest payments are less than inflation. Still, I think it is a problem. Bernie Sanders would solve this issue by raising taxes on the wealthy which would be effective. Donald Trump would do this by bringing more taxable money into the country via better trade deals. 

Finally, one last issue I see with Bernie Sanders is that even though I think higher taxes will solve a lot of problems, I still don't trust the government with its money management. I think Donald Trump would bring much more money back into the country from better trade deals. I don't like Trump's position on Edward Snowden (called him a traitor). I don't think creating more government jobs like Greece did is a solution but it is something I think Bernie Sanders will do. 

I think Barack Obama has done a great job so far. Unemployment is down and healthcare coverage is up. Unfortunately we still have troops all over the world and Russia is growing in size despite economic sanctions. Our Iran deal wasn't that great (we didn't get our hostages back and we had to give Israel free weapons to placate them) and NSA spying seems to have continued although I am not sure after that recent court ruling. Civil rights have improved. 

I know I have mentioned a lot of different issues. The most important one to me is the shrinking wealth of the middle class. I believe the healthiest societies are one where there is small difference between rich and poor. In summary, I think Bernie Sanders treats the symptoms of the problem rather than the root. I think Donald Trump solves the root of the problem by bringing more jobs back to this country. 

I will also mention this because I know it will be brought up - Donald Trump has went into bankruptcy four times. To my understanding, he declared bankruptcy on certain assets and then retained those assets at the lower valuation. I don't know the in's and out's. 

Finally, Donald Trump has a big ego and says idiotic things like 'most of the mexicans crossing the border are rapists.' I know illegal immigrants are a vital part to our country's economy and I didn't like that he said this. However I think what needs to be reformed are laws so that people who want to work can get in more easily. That doesn't mean they should just be able to walk in. I don't care if they do, but I think from a national security standpoint, we should be able to regulate what comes into our borders. Obama has done a great job at making it easier for illegals to get documentation. That said, there are problems that are caused by an unsecured border. The drug traffic is terrible for both the US even worse for Mexico. A secured border would fix this.

I know this has been a lot to read. I take my voting decision very seriously and I want to have good information. Thank you.

"Warning you now, I use some hefty racial slurs in my explanation. I'm not racist and don't support the use of any of these terms, but I'm going to use them here as examples. 

Now I'm not one for overly ""SJW""-like thinking, and I'm not personally outraged by the term, but I'm floored by how rarely I see anyone realize or even acknowledge that the term is racist. The phrasing ""white trash"" assumes that white people are inherently not trash and that this is a special exemption to the rule and needs to be labeled as such. One doesn't say ""black nigger"" or ""mexican spic"", the hate is built into the word itself. The word is the hate label. Having to specify ""white"" before your insult just makes it seem like it's shocking to you that a white person is behaving abnormally. Like they're a weird example of a white person instead of just another white person in a sea of different examples.

Now, I've heard the arguments before that ""there's no good word to throw at white people"" and ""I use the term and I'm not racist"". Neither of these are valid points. A lack of a ""good"" insult doesn't make a bad one ""good"" and your feelings on the matter have no bearing on the reality of how the term is constructed.

I'm not saying people who use the term are racists, I just think they don't realize the implication. Every time I bring this up though I'm downvoted without explanation. The score will drop but I'll hear no hint of rebuttal, which has convinced me I'm right but I'm just saying something they don't like. But hey idk, maybe I'm totally wrong. I'm willing to hear it.

I have probably done a poor job of accurately representing my stance on the issue. In an effort to drive home my logic, I was a little extreme with my phrasing. I will concede that the use of the term isn't insulting to other races, but I think it does hint at the ""white people are normally higher class"" sentiment that fuels the entire phrase. If you find that INSULTING/TRIGGERING or not probably has more to due with you than the phrase but as /u/ratherenjoysbass said in the comments: 

""I think white trash is fucked up in that it inherently assumes that most white people are successful, well-mannered people so we must delineate the people that did not make it as well, for some reason couldn't afford enough class, or are the genetic unwanted when compared to the rest of the white race. Most other racial slurs inherently include the entire race so even a white person saying white trash is still acknowledging racial superiority against the others.""

"This stemmed from a discussion I had on another sub about the Greek economic crisis, and what people are saying should have been done in terms of policy by the EU and the Greek government, which dovetails with what I heard should have been done by the US government in 2008-2010 in the worst part of the Great Recession.

My understanding of Keynesian theory as applied to this kind of economic situation is that it prescribes the government to spend money by using public debt, getting that money to the worker and the spending class. This money, once spent, will require producers to produce more, meaning they need to hire more people, which will give those people more money to spend, creating a virtuous circle of economic growth.

Once recession is over and growth is good, the theory then says that the government should raise revenue out of the booming economy by taxing the producers, the saving class, and the wealthy so as to pay down the debt that it acquired in the previous step.

From that, I conclude that Keynesianism is always either for the working class, the spending class, and the generally poor; and/or against the capitalist, the saving class, and the generally rich. The activities of the former group are economically good and should be encouraged; the activities of the latter group are economically bad (albeit necessary) and should be discouraged, minimized to only what’s absolutely needed to support the activities of the former group.

At this point, I see five possibilities:

1.	Keynesian economics is pure class warfare. Keynes and his followers believe that the working class deserves more and the capitalist class deserves less, and developed a theory to fit that opinion. 
2.	Keynesian economics is co-opted by people with an agenda of pure class warfare. It’s perfectly valid under the theory to create the virtuous circle through government spending on Rolls-Royces and summer homes for the rich, and perfectly possible to pay down government debt by heavy taxes on working-class activities like buying groceries and holding personal debt. How we spend and tax isn’t the issue, just that we do.
3.	I have an incomplete understanding of Keynesian theory. There can arise economic situations where alternative actions are recommended. For instance, once the economy is growing and the debt is paid, does Keynesianism say to reduce both taxes and spending so as to “shake up the system” and achieve new growth? Or any other situation where good economic policy is to increase inequality and use the natural human jealousy, envy, and fear to spur people to produce more?
4.	I have an inaccurate understanding of Keynesian theory in general. 
5. My understanding is accurate, but my logic is faulty.

Right now my view is hovering between One and Two, but I’d really like to understand this theory better.

"Hello. I would like to make the argument that Gender Identity and Gender Roles are one in the same and socially constructed. Many people argue that there are three ways to look at gender.

1. Sex- This is based on physical attributes and is usually binary. This is simply the physical attributes of male, female, and intergender. These are obviously not social constructs.

2. Gender Identity- This is often seen what gender people ""feel"" that they are. For example, a physical male may identify as a female, and therefore their Gender Identity is female.

3. Gender Role- These are simply the societal expectations for each gender to act (i.e. Men don't wear high heels, women are more sensitive and emotional, blah blah blah)

I argue that Gender Identity CAN NOT exist without Gender Roles, and identity is simply based off of perceived Gender Roles... therefore, they are also social constructs. What it means to be a women is not something that we are born with. We are taught what it means to be a man and we are taught what it means to be a women. If someone was never exposed to the social constructs, these identities would not have a foundation to stand on... a socially constructed foundation.

"If the president literally did nothing, old laws would not get renewed, and it would be much harder to pass new laws without the president's signature. Many laws have what are known as Sunset Provisions, where a law must be renewed by a certain time, or the law will no longer be in force. For example, Cuba was on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list, and it was a big deal when they were taken off the list. However, the list has to be renewed every year by the president, all the president had to do was to refuse to sign its renewal.

Another example is the Bush tax cuts, which were set to expire, but they were renewed. A final example is the Patriot Act, which was renewed.

Many people will say that it's up to congress to renew these laws, but the president must sign all laws passed by congress, unless they get a 2/3rds majority. If the president either signs or vetos a law, it will simply not be passed.

The same goes for all laws, since it will be much harder to pass them without the president's signature, and much harder to override a veto if the president never officially vetoed it.

TL;DR A president who does nothing will cause old laws to expire, and make it harder for new laws to be passed.

This scenario is when a president literally does nothing, he doesn't sign a single form or attend a single event. There could simply be no president with all this stuff happening automatically and it would be the same. To change my view, you must tell me why this would be bad. Remember, if a president did nothing, fewer new laws would passed, and older laws would expire.

"I am angry beyond exasperation by the generalised hate some of the SJWs I appear to follow/friend are sharing/re-sharing on Twitter/Facebook recently.

I can't stand by it any longer -- if you share something that generalises men / women / white people / asian people / immigrants / wealthy people / poor people / Northern / Southern / City / Rural... In fact, pretty much anything you attack by generalising a group based on one bad example -- I feel the need to not only unfollow you, I think I need to make sure you understand why I'm doing it. Publicly.

That goes equally for people that make unfair assertions about people it's ""cool"" to hate: Such as calling UKIP (UK Independence Party who exist to try and remove the UK from the EU) racists, or Conservatives (once again, a UK political party, currently in Government office) thieves, or the police thugs. I've never met a racist UKIP member, a Conservative thief, or a police thug.

Prejudice happens. We all have prejudices. I have prejudices. Allowing that prejudice to become discrimination, and that discrimination becoming openly attacking people is something we all need to combat. If one of your friends starting mouthing obscenities towards a gay man, or a black woman, I'd hope you'd try to stop them. You should do the same for someone attacking a straight man too because he's male and straight and not because he's done something himself.

Somehow it has become acceptable to post insulting things like https://twitter.com/flexlibris/status/621873976063692800 which tar all men (in this particular example) with the same brush. People I respect retweet it. That's just not fair, and it's something I can't put up with any longer.

If you want to point out a man acting inappropriately, that's fine by me. I've done it before, and while I know a lot of people just turn away and pretend it's not happening, I'd like to believe that many would say something.

If you say all men are trash, you're attacking me and I've done nothing wrong.

This kind of generalisation behaviour is completely unacceptable to me, and these people are just as bad -- no, they're WORSE than the people they're trying to oppose. They DO know better and choose to be inflammatory.

Generalising a group of people based on bad information is exactly why many major conflicts occur worldwide. I'm not talking about in history and making a veiled Nazi reference, I'm talking about today. People today are excluded because of sweeping generalisations like the ones these people perpetuate.

I can't stand silently by it any longer. If I don't speak out against it, it gives silent consent to those that do it. However, I realise that perhaps I'm over-reacting and there's another side to this story.

So, before I go on a massive unfollow and outrage spree amongst people posting SJW type material: (Try and...) Change My View!

"A popular opinion among the American electorate is that teachers should make more money. 

I'm not an expert in economics but I think the assumption here is a labor theory of value. People look at the number of labor hours and the ""difficulty"" of teaching, plus the social importance of teaching, and conclude that teachers are underpaid. It also pulls on the heart strings to support teachers. The same layman economic presuppositions underlie the idea that sports players are grossly overpaid.

However, prices cannot be determined beyond supply and demand. Since teachers do not operate in a free market, for the most part, we cannot really say how accurate their salaries are.

"This thought started out when I was watching Blazing Saddles with a group that included my father-in-law. Right before the scene when the guys are sitting around the campfire eating beans, my father-in-law mentions that he doesn't know why this scene is in the movie. When the men start farting, I start laughing like a maniac because I think farts are hilarious.

Now to my view, farts are the purest form of comedy. What do I mean by this? Farts are universal and everyone can relate to them. Farts don't make fun or antagonize any group of people.
Farts innocently remind us of a daily bodily function that is gross, but often in a humorous manner. There are practical jokes that can be played with no one getting harmed (rolling and locking car windows). I would also hope that just by seeing the title of this post makes some people internally chuckle.

So, to most easily change my view, someone would have to come up with another humorous thing that is ""more pure."" Meaning, no one is antagonized and that everyone can relate to and funnier than farts. I'm open to other things changing my view, but can't really think of anything else off the top of my head.

Those who are in control and in power are there for a reason. They may be primarily of a certain race, or a certain gender, but that wasn't by accident. If the weak are allowed to take control of the steering wheel by a helping hand, sure everyone will applaud you and say what a good thing you've done at first.

"Context: I'm a straight cis man with a lot of straight friends (as well as LGBTQA+ friends) who often go to Boston Pride Parade and NYC Pride Parade. I've never gone to one myself (always find out about it a few days after it happens), but I'm planning on going to volunteer at next year's Boston parade, assuming I'm home from school in time.

I personally get a little uncomfortable when I see straight people partying hard at Pride parades. To me, the parades are supposed to celebrate marginalized social groups who are often shoved under wave after wave of oppression and hatred the other 364 days of the year and has this one day to fully let loose and celebrate in the face of a culture who still may not accept them in the way that they'd like. When straight people jump in, it almost feels like they're co-opting the one day in which non-straight people are finally in control. It seems to me to be similar to straight people putting a rainbow filter over their profile pictures - in theory, it might be OK, but in practice it shifts the attention from the LGBTQA+ people who deserve it onto the straight person who steps in. Almost like a ""Look at me, I'm celebrating pride! Look at how great I am!""

And, yeah, to a certain extent I think this display of solidarity is good. Gay/trans/queer rights won't move forward without the support of those already in power - straight people - and it's nice to see people united across gender and sexuality boundaries in order to celebrate how far we've come and prepare for how far we still have to go. That being said, though, I think there's a point at which a display of solidarity becomes less about the people for whom the solidarity is shown and more about the people who are ""showing"" the solidarity. I think that at a certain point, support for the LGBTQA+ community can transition into an exercise in self-promotion and narcissism, and I'm not super comfortable with that.

This is why I think that straight/cis people who participate in Pride parades should spend some of that participation on volunteering. The parades really run on volunteers, and if a straight/cis person spends time doing the thankless task of picking up trash, filling and lugging big containers of water everywhere, or making sure a first-aid tent is properly staffed, it helps show support for the LGBTQA+ community in a way that simply taking selfies with a shirtless parader will never be able to. I think it's a great way to be an ally to the community in a way that doesn't obnoxiously trumpet that allyship, and it might teach people more about what really makes the revelry run smoothly and give them a new appreciation for something many almost take for granted.

tl;dr Volunteering is a helpful form of allyship for straight/cis people in a way that just going to the parade and celebrating is not.

EDIT: Just a clarification - I believe that people shouldn't be forced to volunteer, and going to the parade at all is still preferable by far to not going. That said, I think that going and volunteering is far enough preferable to just going to participate that it should be pretty heavily suggested for people planning to go.

If it's your content, or your identity, or your friends, I get that. You &amp; your little group are giving consent to uploading your material to the internet.

Yes, they dressed that way to go to the grocery store &amp; be seen by others, that was their choice. I get it. But what right had you to pull out your smartphone, snap their picture, and upload it to the internet for the whole world to laugh at? Some of those people have mental illnesses, or other issues.

I've heard it said that the Internet writes in ink. Once uploaded, it may never be truly &amp; fully erased. By uploading pictures of strangers to the internet, if it trends &amp; goes viral, you are responsible for having permanently compromised any hopes of relative privacy that person may have had.

"I am an American High School student who was taught 2 different versions of the Civil war throughout my schooling career.

In elementary school we first learned about the civil war in fourth grade. In that unit, we were taught the very bare details of the war: The south seceded when they couldn't keep their slaves, and declared war on the north in doing so, Lincoln was a great guy who freed all the slaves with the emancipation proclamation, and then the north won.

In 8th grade I was taught more details to the story. The south seceded because the right of the states to decide on whether they keep slaves was being questioned, as well as there being the beginning of unequal representation of slave-nonslave states. The south secedes, war begins. I was taught this more comprehensive view in more detail in my junior year of High School, with emphasis on the economic and cultural dichotomy of the north and south: The north was a manufacturing powerhouse that didn't need slaves, and the South was largely agricultural and couldn't afford to not use slaves.

I, as a student, preferred being taught the States' rights version of the civil war, as it shows that the South was not comprised of nothing but slave-owning bigots, but that both sides were trying to preserve their way of life. This also allows for a better understanding of the reasoning behind how Reconstruction and Civil rights' issues were handled in the south.

I want to understand why people are against this form of teaching the civil war, so please, CMV

"I don't particularly hold this view dearly, I just expect there might be some budding historians on Reddit with more information! It was influenced mostly by this article, the continent would have flourished economically, socially and politically, more so than now. I will highlight the main points below. 


1. Revolutionary domestic reforms which all of Europe would have continued to benefit from.

""Yet he said he would be remembered not for his military victories, but for his domestic reforms, especially the Code Napoleon, that brilliant distillation of 42 competing and often contradictory legal codes into a single, easily comprehensible body of French law. In fact, Napoleon’s years as first consul, from 1799 to 1804, were extraordinarily peaceful and productive. He also created the educational system based on lycées and grandes écoles and the Sorbonne, which put France at the forefront of European educational achievement. He consolidated the administrative system based on departments and prefects. He initiated the Council of State, which still vets the laws of France, and the Court of Audit, which oversees its public accounts. He organized the Banque de France and the Légion d’Honneur, which thrive today. He also built or renovated much of the Parisian architecture that we still enjoy, both the useful—the quays along the Seine and four bridges over it, the sewers and reservoirs—and the beautiful, such as the Arc de Triomphe, the Rue de Rivoli and the Vendôme column.""

Napoleon was an extraordinary governor. Many of his reforms are what the rest of Europe based their institutions on, only much later.


2. Napoleon was a lover, not a fighter.

In September 1805, Austria invaded Napoleon’s ally Bavaria, and Russia declared war on France as well. Napoleon swiftly won the ensuing War of the Third Coalition with his finest victory, at Austerlitz in 1805. The next year the Prussians also declared war on him, but they were soundly defeated at Jena; Napoleon’s peace treaty of Tilsit with Russia and Prussia followed. The Austrians declared war on France once more in 1809, but were dispatched at the Battle of Wagram and signed yet another peace treaty.

Napoleon started none of those wars, but he won all of them. After 1809 there was an uneasy peace with the three other Continental powers, but in 1812 he responded to France’s being cut out of Russian markets—in violation of the Tilsit terms—by invading Russia. That ended in the catastrophic retreat from Moscow, which cost him more than half a million casualties and left his Grande Armée too vitiated to deter Austria and Prussia from joining his enemies Russia and Britain in 1813.

Bar the Russian Invasion mistake (and I will concede that it was a hell of a mistake), Napoleon did not display the characteristics of a warmonger. Upon his return from exile, his charisma as a leader ensured he reclaimed the throne without shedding a drop of blood, as each army sent to fight him joined him immediately. 

When he was condemned by the allies in the Vienna Declaration, he wrote to them - “After presenting the spectacle of great campaigns to the world, from now on it will be more pleasant to know no other rivalry than that of the benefits of peace, of no other struggle than the holy conflict of the happiness of peoples.”

You can argue that it was just posturing, but there is no precedent to suggest it was not genuine.

He told his council that he had renounced any dream of reconstituting the empire and that “henceforth the happiness and the consolidation” of France “shall be the object of all my thoughts.” He refrained from taking measures against anyone who had betrayed him the previous year. “Of all that individuals have done, written or said since the taking of Paris,” he proclaimed, “I shall forever remain ignorant.” He immediately set about instituting a new liberal constitution incorporating trial by jury, freedom of speech and a bicameral legislature that curtailed some of his own powers; it was written by the former opposition politician Benjamin Constant, whom he had once sent into internal exile.

He immediately set about refunding the art galleries and public buildings of Paris, in the 12 weeks before the war would begin.

3. Liberalism in the rest of Europe would have thrived.

If Napoleon had remained emperor of France for the six years remaining in his natural life, European civilization would have benefited inestimably. The reactionary Holy Alliance of Russia, Prussia and Austria would not have been able to crush liberal constitutionalist movements in Spain, Greece, Eastern Europe and elsewhere; pressure to join France in abolishing slavery in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean would have grown; the benefits of meritocracy over feudalism would have had time to become more widely appreciated; Jews would not have been forced back into their ghettos in the Papal States and made to wear the yellow star again; encouragement of the arts and sciences would have been better understood and copied; and the plans to rebuild Paris would have been implemented, making it the most gorgeous city in the world.




TL;DR - Napoleon was an all round great dude, and great leader who accomplished so much in such little time. If he had stayed in power for the 6 more years until his death, France and Europe would have benefitted greatly from it.

This post makes a very compelling point with tons of evidence to back up the stance. Compensating for individual biases, this still makes sense in my mind.

As a minority, I have felt the effects of social engineering firsthand. Asian achieves academically? Expected. White achieves academically? Studious, hard working, brilliant. Media headlines such as ""Asians too smart for their own good"" (Ivy league schools refuse high-scoring Asians) come with subtle implications that the Asian identity is attached to intelligence.

Furthermore, look at Hollywood. Positive Asian male role models: Sung Kang? Most films in Hollywood that cast Asians cast them in one of these roles:

 Nerd
 Joker
 Hardworking worker, but not leader
 Involved in organized crime (is antagonist/evil-protagonist)

Meanwhile, most Asian women are cast as the ""prize"" for the dominant white lead role. For example, Hugh Jackman and Tao Okamoto in ""The Wolverine."" One could argue that Rila Fukushima was cast to demonstrate a strong, independent female role model, but that doesn't change the fact that the romantic interest was obviously forcefully written into the film like an afterthought in order to generate revenue.

This is just some of my experience as an Canadian Asian. Based on my understanding of black stereotypes, black people must experience a similar kind of racism, but reversed. The analysis of the dichotomic nature of asian racism vs black racism in the linked post is very accurate, in my opinion.

"I’m a pretty analytical person who favours fact over opinion. I’ve been exposed to a lot of self-help techniques through my family which I have always been quite disparaging of it. Recently I have been advised by a ‘career coach’ to create mantras for myself and to write these down and repeat them every day with the idea that it would help me realise my goals (and ultimately get a job.)


I want to believe in it, I think, but at its core it feels like the opposite of the fact-based view I hold about life. An example shown to me of a mantra is “I am positive thinking in everything I think and do.”  By repeating this every day one is supposed to have this quality ingrained into themselves until it becomes self-fulfilling. My immediate reaction to it is that it’s lying to yourself. Instead of trying to trick yourself into believing something that isn’t true you should be realistic and think about why you don’t think positively and how you can resolve this.


When explaining my hesitations my career coach raised a point about pro sports players. Psychology is what separates the great from the good and a lot of that is in self-belief which I totally get and agree with. He then said “If it’s good enough for Mohammed Ali, its good enough for me.” This helped a bit though I’m still not thoroughly convinced.


I still find the idea of the repeating one of these mantras so corny and I don’t think I could do it wholeheartedly with belief in it which would be needed for it to help.

"I just don't understand how in an era when poverty is growing tremendously in America, and inequality is more ridiculous than it's been in any time since the era of lords and serfs, that people can have the nerve to whine and complain that the poor are spoiled and entitled and the rich are being persecuted.

Without social welfare and programs for people who need them, America would become similar to Latin American and African countries where you have a few hundred families that own everything, a small middle class that caters to them and defends them, and then the majority who are impoverished and have no hope of advancement or any opportunities and live in slums and favelas.

Hell, it's ALREADY becoming this way. Tent cities are popping up in America everyone, and homelessness is becoming more and more of a problem. Yet people seem to be in complete denial and will endlessly defend corporate greed and blame the poor for their own suffering.

Our democracy has already suffered so much from corporate control - how the hell can anyone advocate or suggest there isn't ENOUGH corporate power or influence in politics? Abolishing the government or reducing it to a ""night watchman"" state would only mean that corporations and the rich elite would be DIRECTLY calling the shots, rather than have to pull the government's strings to get their way.

The people who would suffer most from libertarianism are the weak, of course. The elderly, people with disabilities and children, who without support from the state would either die of starvation and untreated illnesses or would have to pimp themselves out to perverts, the majority of them who aren't lucky enough to be taken on by a benefactor.

Minorities would also suffer since their lower financial status would be even more of a burden to them than it already is in a semi-democratic society. Libertarians can claim to be socially liberal as long as they want, but considering they almost always side with the GOP over the Left or even the centrist Democrats it's obvious that money is far more important to them than the rights of minorities.

These guys are pretty much the same as the Nazis. Don't they realize that if labor had rights and were paid more fair wages, there wouldn't be as much of a need for welfare?

"I have had friendships with various males, and only one of them has not tried to at one point in time, make it sexual. This was not a big deal when I wasn't in a relationship and I would just turn them down. Once I was, they all tried much harder than usual to pursue something whereas before it was a more passive attempt. Once they realized I was ""off the table"" of sorts and was serious about my now boyfriend, the relationship just dwindled despite my continuing to talk to them just as much as before. I realized this was because the conversation would always be very short due to me not replying to flirtatious texts which probably got really boring for them. 

What I mean by men and women cannot be just friends is that one or the other (possibly both), even if not having a physical relationship, is using each other for the ego boost that comes with someone of the opposite sex giving you attention and would under other circumstances, definitely hook up (or maybe at one point in time already have).  I also noticed even women who have a lot of male friends they spent a lot of time with and ""friend zoned"" them, they would still get weird and upset if the man was in a romantic relationship and therefore had less time to expend for her because it was going to his SO. This doesn't happen with their male friends as long as they see them enough because the male friends aren't using their male friends to feel attractive.. but suddenly ""just"" female friends tend to get very territorial once they aren't getting the attention from the male friend that they were used to or able to get that constant validation. 

Of course there will ALWAYS be exceptions. But I think, on average, this all proves to be true. This is also why I am pretty uncomfortable with my boyfriend having female friends that aren't also people I've met and felt comfortable with. He can, of course, but it makes me feel uncomfortable. The one he introduced me to automatically displayed the classic signs of using him for attention and being very touchy but pretending it's simply a ""brother"" like relationship. I would like to be comfortable with such friendships but it seems unnecessary to me within a relationship. In a group setting is fine, of course, as long as everyone is comfortable (which doesn't seem to happen if the friend has been in the persons life longer than the SO) but I am talking about opposite sex friendships when one or both parties are in a relationship with other people...I feel they have no reason to spend a lot of time interacting or spending time together one-on-one unless they are both lying to each other (or one person is) and hoping that something will happen (sexually or otherwise) without admitting it to themselves or like the in my opinion inappropriate feeling of playing with fire. 

I hold myself to the same standard, of course. My one male friend that has not tried anything was also my roommate but I always included my boyfriend and introduced them, and they became friends even. We would hang out alone sometimes but in public (during daytime) or just while one or the other is in the kitchen cooking. I don't think anything would happen if we did drink alone, as we have before I was dating my boyfriend, but I would respect my relationship enough that I'm not really interested in doing that anyway. I also have zero sexual attraction for him and imagine this is the same with him, towards me. This is ONE of those exceptions out of the plenty of male friends who out of nowhere have tried to hook up or tell me they have feelings for me and I suspect is not the average dynamic of a male-female friendship. So while I think it MAY be possible, it is somewhat rare. 

Obviously my view also applies to those who are strictly in monogamous relationships.

Tl;dr: 
Most men who have female ""platonic"" friends would sleep with them if the opportunity arose and if are in a relationship, only keep them around in case and because of the ego boost of being around women who aren't unattractive (to feel wanted). Most women who have male ""platonic"" friends are using them for the attention they get by feeling a man likes them, and can't have them to feel like a sought-after, high quality woman...and also get jealous when they begin dating a woman despite their ""just friend"" claims. always exceptions, but believe this to be generally true.

"With all that is going on with Reddit lately I think the big thing that is being ignored is that this is largely a White male community. When it functioned in that way everything seemed to go more or less fine (of course there were others interspersed but that was the majority of viewpoints). As more and more groups began to be introduced there were shall we say competing interests. They correctly are asking for space within the community as well. However, the problem is White men had already kind of adopted this space as a place where they could discuss their problems without feeling guilty etc. For example, when people complain about false rape charges getting to the front page constantly or reverse discrimination cases etc etc. I think the SJW this and that we often see is just pushback from White Men feeling ""invaded"" for lack of a better word. I'm not saying this is right. I think this last ush of banning subs etc also has the same implications first FatPeopleHate is seen as appealing to women and feminists. Then Coontown seen as appealing to minorities. I think its reflective of White Men feeling like all other people get to have their spaces etc. but they never do. What I got from the threads is that people feel betrayed and I believe that feeling is genuine. 

So here's the actual CMV. Why can't everyone just let White Guys have this one. Why can't we all just either accept that this is and will be a site that leans towards issues important to (straight) White Men and will be biased towards their opinions or leave and go to a different site. Its not like their aren't other hubs. And I'm not saying that there shouldn't be differences of opinion etc. (newsflash: not all White guys think the same). But just as anyone is welcome to watch Logo and comment on it etc no one would complain that the content is too gay or be upset if anti-gay things or things that appear to be anti-gay get the equivalent of downvoted (and no I'm not comparing experiences in any way). I also think that if people recognized this gping in there would be less abrasive push back from the trolls and ""dark side"" of reddit.

This issue has only been a concern of mine in recent months, in part due my exposure to the idea on reddit/other internet sources, and partly because I've never been in an environment where sexual encounters are frequent. I don't think I'm of the party that has difficulty understanding consent. I also understand that there may be a great deal of fear for some women that they may be raped, and I don't wish to sound as though I'm downplaying that. But I have a fear myself of being falsely accused, or accused in a case where consent is retroactively removed. I don't think of this potential as being very high; I don't think most women are that vindictive; however in the event that it occurs it seems the results can be devastating. I've personally spoken to someone who has gone through this process and it took him almost a year to clear his name. 

I don't want this fear; I'm very open to the idea that it may be exaggerated in the media I've read, or that there are faults in my reasoning. But these are potentials and I can't seem to confirm them on my own; maybe someone else can poke some holes.

"When I look to modern Cinema, I see a huge tumor, in the middle. Basicly, all-of-yours Avengers, Iron-mans or Suicide-Squats-things. My problem is that I cant see the point or the reason for watching, or even creating sort-of-these high-budget low-artform movies. 


One thing I wont get is why people watching these movies, their reboots over and over past decades. I can accept that old spiderman movies from early 2000s are childhood for some people and I fully respect it.  But what is gonna give you when you make reboot (like latest spiderman honestly), which is ruining franchise? Are you aiming for lower-age audience? Are doing it JUST for money? Dont know the answer.

Then, there comes a popularity of those movies. Did we came to stage that we are going to Cinema only for those ""films"" but killing the rest of the cinema originality? When you come to that stage, Hollywood biggest studios have only concern for this type of extremly profitable movies and loosing care of ""true movies"".

Then, I cant stand the marketing of the movies. You can see list of next superhero movies by marvel or DC for next 10 years, whats the point of that? That you will see next 10 same bad movies only with different villain? By my point, when you are longering the franchise for long as possible, you are fooling your fans.

Then, there is a Superhero films in nutshell: People (or heroes, avengers, what-so-ever) are doing extremly unlogical decisions, killing people like robots (no emotion in there) and just killing villains, prepairing for it or just making their way of their personal problems. This is same for most of the movies. (If I didnt saw some best superhero movie, whitch doesnt do wrong these things, reccommend me one). 

For once in while, I can see a good superhero movie, like Batman trilogy from Christopher Nolan. They are doing same things (beating villains, prepairing....) but they are doing it in way to respect the franchise. And its offen rare that someone like Nolan will accept a offer for another superhero blockbuster. 

Am I too old, or the movies are for 12year olds (like MLP), but adults love it anyway? Can someone tell me? Besides that, please dont look at my grammar. Its extremly late and Im tired as hell.

Thanks, and CMV :).

Edit 1: Much thanks for really great amount of replies and CMVs, I dont know if I can answer them all as well (maybe sometime). CMV community somehow explained to me how big is lore behind ""SH movies"", or how helpful they can be for people who cant read comics. BUT, I AM NOT SATISFIED with one thing. WHY these movies are people prefering then something new and fresh, why they want to see same exact movies for next 10 years or why ""casual viewers"" dont try something new.  Thanks for each letter your write.

"Reddit, I have been causally watching this Jeb Bush comment make its rounds around the internet and news sites. It seemed pretty obvious to me the first time I heard it that he was talking about trying to reduce part time jobs and have more full time jobs. I am not trying to debate the merit of his argument or if the president has any say on if this could happen or not.

Bush Interview:

 BUSH: My aspiration for the country and I believe we can achieve it, is 4% growth as far as the eye can see. Which means we have to be a lot more productive, workforce participation has to rise from its all-time modern lows. It means that people need to work longer hours and, through their productivity, gain more income for their families. That's the only way we're going to get out of this rut that we're in.
 
 QUESTION: To keep us from taking it out of context, what you meant to say — when you say more hours you mean full-time work.
 
 BUSH: Given the opportunity to work. Yeah, absolutely.
 
 QUESTION: Not that a full-time guy or somebody working two jobs needs to be working even more time.
 
 BUSH: Absolutely not. Their incomes need to grow. It's not going to grow in an environment where the costs of doing business are so extraordinarily high here. Healthcare costs are rising. In many places the cost of doing business is extraordinarily high, and the net result of that is that business start up rates are at an all-time low. Work-force participation rates are low. If anyone is celebrating this anemic recovery, then they are totally out of touch. The simple fact is people are really struggling. So giving people a chance to work longer hours has got to be part of the answer. If not, you are going to see people lose hope. And that's where we are today.

Obama's Quote: 

""If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business — you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn’t get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet.""
It seems like everyone is trying to pull these comments out of context. Reddit pleas change my view. Am I missing something?

"Note: I do not believe that these prove anything conclusively, either the truth of the torah nor the existence of god, just that these predictions make a very strong case. 

Deuteronomy 28 consists, basically, of a long series of predictions for the fate of the jews. Among these are that the temple will be destroyed, the jews will be scattered across the globe, they will be persecuted and remain small in number,  and that they will eventually return to the land of israel. 

Im currently on mobile with a very poor connection and can not find all of the relevant quotes but here are some:

""The Lord will bring a nation against you from afar, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flies, a nation whose language you will not understand, a nation of fierce countenance, which does not respect the elderly nor show favour to the young.""

When the jews were conquered and the temple was destroyed, it was done so by the romans who spoke latin. The jews at this time would not have understood latin.  However, had nearly any other large or close nation been the ones to attack the jews, it is very likely that they would have known the language. Many of the closer nations, the jews traded with or dealt with politically and thus would have known their language.  Because of this, predicting that their conquerors would speak an unknown language is not a likely prediction and it is strange that it comes true. 

""AND THE L-RD SHALL SCATTER THEE AMONG ALL PEOPLE, FROM THE ONE END OF THE EARTH EVEN UNTO THE OTHER; AND THERETHOU SHALT SERVE OTHER G-DS,""

When the jews were conquered, they were scattered across the lands. This is strange both as a prediction and as an event. After conquering a nation, it was rare, if it happened at all, for the nation to be dispersed in this manner. Usually the conquerors would either use their victims as slaves, or keep them around to collect taxes. To disperse a nation like this makes no sense because then the conquerors have much less to gain. 

""You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left but few in number, because you did not obey the Lord your God.""

The prediction here is that the jewish population will remain small. This has also come true. The current jewish population is around 14.2 millions people, or only .2% of the world. While few in number is not specific, remaining less than a percent of the world seems to be fairly small. 

""Among those nations you will find no repose, no resting place for the sole of your foot. There the Lord will give you an anxious mind, eyes weary with longing, and a despairing heart. 66 You will live in constant suspense, filled with dread both night and day, never sure of your life.""

This verse seems to indicate the ever presence of anti-semitism.  Despite being so small in numbers, jews have faced persecution at nearly every place they have gone. This prediction seems more obvious, as many strangers seem to face discrimination, but a prediction that came true regardless. 

Edit:  I don't have any more time to post tonight, but I will be able to read anything posted tomorrow. I awarded one delta for proof that the jews would have very likely spoken latin at that time. Any further direct contradictions to any of the prophecies, as well as any other prophecies in this section of the torah that don't come true would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, examples of predictions from other major religions that came true in similar matters would help. Thanks CMV!

""The Lord your God will return your captivity and have mercy upon you and he will gather you in from all the nations to He had scattered you. Even if you will be dispersed to the end of the Heavens – from there your God will gather you…God will gather you and bring you back to the land that your forefathers possessed and you shall posses it.”

This is actually from chapter 30, but is still relevant. To have predicted 3000 years ago that the jews would not only be kicked out of israel, but would eventually come back to own it is remarkable. It could be argued that this is a self-fulfilling prophecy, Israel was only given to the jews because of this prediction, but even if that is the case it is still incredible to have predicted 3000 years ago that not only would the jews still be around but that they would be able to reclaim ownership of israel. 

It is my belief that these predictions make a strong case for the truth of the torah. Not only did they come true, but they are predictions that did not make sense to make at the time, and would have seemed at the time to be very unlikely. The fact that they came true is at the very least a remarkable coincidence, and creates very strong evidence for the torah to be taken as truth. ","{'he', 'lord'}"

"Edit: I think I may have overestimated the problem, due in part to my sources, and in part to my zealousness. Many comments so far have pointed out that even if all of this were true, it would not constitute a police state. I'm willing to give quite a bit of ground on that phrase, as I likely used it without thinking it through.

Edit 2: I'm sorry some people think I'm a shill. I'm just a concerned guy trying to help.

First Amendment

Cops can tell you what to say, taze you for arguing with them, arrest journalists, and arrest you for filming them. They can break up peaceful protests by force. They bring assault weapons to memorial services and gay rights marches and anti-war demonstrations.

Here are some stories about arrests of journalists.

Second Amendment

Most states don't seem to have tried to take your guns away, but that won't stop them from arming the police with military weapons. If the police attack you, where can you go for help? Why are the (civilian) police forces authorized to carry weapons which are illegal in the states they police? Do police really get into gunfights with heavily armed drug dealers and save the lives of crowds of law abiding citizens, like something out of a 1980's cop thriller?

Here(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militarization_of_police) is the wiki about police militarization.

Fourth Amendment

Cops can seize your property without cause or warrant (civil forfeiture), and search your car, phone, or house without cause or warrant. Don't believe me? Look it up. Multiple recent court decisions defend an officer's wish to do whatever he wants with your things.

Here is an article about the most recent supreme court decision on searches.

This(https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&amp;rlz=1C1ASUC_enUS632US632&amp;es_sm=93&amp;q=police+raid+the+wrong+house&amp;oq=police+raid+the+wrong+house&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0j0i22i30l9.269565.274940.0.275095.27.25.0.0.0.0.299.3358.0j18j2.20.0....0...1c.1.64.serp..7.20.3353.s4Q1aX2iVQY) is just a google page, but how many of these wrong house, no knock searches are too many?

Here(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States) is the wiki about civil forfeiture.

It appears the court has ruled that police -do- need a warrant to search your cell phone.

Fifth Amendment

Cops can arrest you on the spot for literally anything they see fit, and you will be held -at least- until your bail hearing, and you will be lucky if you can afford your bail. Also, they can compel you through whatever means they see fit (lying, threatening, depriving of basic needs, torture) to bear testimony against yourself, even if you are innocent (any testimony given under duress is admissible to the court, and usually leads to conviction regardless of proof-of-guilt). Also, they fund their own departments by issuing citations and stealing property (seriously, if you haven't looked up civil forfeiture, do it now).

Here(https://youtu.be/6wXkI4t7nuc?t=1656) is a good video where a Virginia Beach officer explains criminal 'interviews.' If you have time to really watch this, please listen to what he says, and how he says it. His job is to look for wrongdoing, and he freely admits that if he wants to pull someone over, he can follow them until they do something he can pull them over for. This(https://youtu.be/6wXkI4t7nuc?t=1881) is where he starts to describe interrogation specifically.

Sixth Amendment

You can be kept in jail for years before you are brought before a judge, and can expect no help or information from the prison guards. Guards are there to keep people in, not to save lives. Numerous cases are rising to the public view regarding prison conditions, and maybe we should start throwing the 'cruel and unusual' term around. Either way, in 2011, about 3 people died in American jails -every day- with countless others tortured or left off the books (think Chicago's interrogation fiasco this year, or Guantanamo).

Here is an article about Chicago's secret prison.

Here is an article about police killings. Note the fact that they aren't even tracked very carefully.

Here is an article about deaths in prisons. Again, information is out of date, and possibly inaccurate.

Eighth Amendment

Some Judges set reasonable bail, others do not. Some of the Judges caught setting unreasonable bail are called out, or disciplined, most are not. Chances are very good you will not be able to afford bail if you go inside. Think about that next time you're tempted to flip off a police officer.

I'm having a hard time finding specifics about the time between an arrest and a bail hearing, but pages I visit says it varies state by state, with multiple lawyers giving anecdotes of people waiting up to a year in jail before being -acquitted- because they couldn't make bail. Personally, I have known more than one person to spend months in jail after being unable to afford bail. Whether or not someone is found guilty, shouldn't this be viewed as a violation of our right to a speedy trial? Not sure about that one.

Here are some statistics on drug bail.

Here is a document full of prison statistics, most relevantly, bail rates.

Bottom line:

You don't have rights anymore. Each of the constitutional rights we have were set forth by Americans to protect their families from overzealous government officials. These rights are not there to protect you from your neighbors. They aren't there to protect you from your employer. They were written specifically to protect you from the Government, and they have failed. Remember your history, read the constitution. Every one of the rights Americans hold dear is being violated by police, judges, and politicians every day. Every Day. EVERY DAY. Every bullshit arrest, every bullshit sentence, every bullshit traffic stop, every bullshit roadside search. If you try to exercise your right to free speech, you can be stopped for it. If you argue with the officer, he will pull you out of the car for an arrest and search without warrant. If you resist him in any way, or if you can't hear him, or if you step on the brake pedal by mistake, or if you just don't fall on your face quickly enough, he will shoot you. Those are the facts.

Every year, another generation of high-school students reads 1984, by Orwell. They tell us what to buy, and at what price (medicine, insurance). They tell us our wars are moral, or economically sound. They tell us who to love (media, soldiers, 'heros'). They tell us who to hate (war, media, socialists, WBC). We are in a constant state of war on at least one front (Germany, Vietnam, Korea, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Egypt, Russia, Mexico, and God only knows where else). They lie to us, and suppress anyone looking for the truth (media, arrest of journalists, denying the right to assemble or film officers). They tell us what to believe. They tell us how to behave. They will kill you if you do not fall in line exactly when and how they tell you.

It might not look like you live in a police state. After all, you can drive to work, do your job, buy your groceries, and go on vacation. However, if a police officer, a judge, or anyone else has the authority to ignore the Constitution of the United States of America, what else can you call it? Do I need to dare you to piss off a cop? If you know what will happen when you piss off a cop, how can you accept that? Why are police even authorized to use deadly force? You really want them to kill someone for speeding? Well what about stealing your car, can we kill them then? How many lives are saved through the use of deadly force? Is it worth it?

Well it isn't worth it to me. I'm going to keep my head down until I can afford to get the Hell out of here. I'd rather Live as a citizen of the World than Die as a citizen of this country.

If you think the constitution protects you (at all), think again. They are walking all over your rights, and you aren't going to notice until they arrest you, or kill your children. If they never do, you will live your life among the sheeple, waiting for the law to tell you how to live.

I'm sorry if this comes across as somewhat belligerent, but I believe the seriousness of the situation in this country isn't exactly sinking in for the general public. Am I wrong? Is it already getting better? Are citizens safer than they used to be? Is my information wrong or biased? I would love a discussion about what we are doing right, what we are doing wrong, and what we can do next.

"First off, this isn't about transsexual people. If people aren't comfortable with the genitals they were born with, well then it's their bodies to do with what they like; power to them.  
  
However, when transgender people say that they feel like they're the opposite gender, it stops making sense. If a person who was born male decides that they feel like they're a female, what are they basing that on? What does being female feel like, and how would they know? Doesn't that imply that females feel a certain way, and males another way? Isn't that considered backwards? Obviously the same goes for born-females who claim that they feel male.

"Donald Trump and his campaign has been in the news for quite some time. He's been the butt of many jokes. Many think he is hurting the Republican party and their image but I think the other candidates could learn a lot from him and the way he is campaigning. 

The main reason is because he is being unapologetic. What Trump said about immigration was not racist. He did not say Mexicans or people of Latino descent were rapists and drug dealers, he claimed there is a high percentage of crime from ILLEGAL immigrants and that the Mexican government shoves their criminals into the American jail and healthcare systems instead of dealing with them on their own. Now, I've looked and looked and found many conservative sources that back his claim and many liberal sources that refute it, but it is not a racist comment regardless of whether or not it is factually correct. He didn't say immigrants, he didn't say Mexicans or Latinos, he said illegal immigrants. 

Most political candidates would come out and apologize profusely and try to further clarify their point after such backlash but not Trump. Trump is standing by his words. The Democrats have been very good lately at painting their opposition as racist, sexist, etc. as a retort and Trump is not having it. He is taking the offensive instead of taking the defensive which both Romney and McCain did which is accredited to their loss.

If you look at the last presidential election, what were the candidates saying about each other? The Romney campaign painted Obama as a nice guy. He was the kind of guy you'd like to get a beer with and is a good family man, but he is an incompetent president and will lead us into financial ruin. What did the Obama campaign say about Romney? That he hates women, he hates gays, he hates Latinos,  he tied his dog to the top of his car, he fired some guy which then killed his wife, and he doesn't pay his taxes. Most people will vote for a good guy that screws up over a terrible awful person.

Trump is not taking that stuff lying down. He's fighting back twice as hard. He's responding to his critics with twice the ferocity that they came at him with. The Republicans are not going to win if they continue to try and be the bigger person and not get down and dirty with the mudslinging that is American politics. The Republicans and their leadership have been sheepish ever since Bush's horrible second term and it is costing them elections and they are losing their base. 

If you saw Chris Christie's speech, he blamed both parties for failing to compromise and for the state of the country. Do you see any Democrats blaming the Democratic party for anything and vowing to work with Republicans? That is not a strategy that will win.

Check out Trump's interview on NBC with Katy Tur. She constantly asks him leading questions about his offensive comments and Trump does not let her control the interview in any way. Many other Republicans would respond diplomatically in order to appear reasonable but Trump got it right. He stood by his words and didn't apologize. Do you remember during the Republican primaries of 2012 when George Stephanopoulos asked Romney questions about whether or not he supported states banning all birth control even though there were no states or candidates that supported that? Romney let him run all over him with that ridiculous question. Trump wouldn't stand for that shit and he would call Stephanopoulos out on that.

The Republicans were unhappy with McCain, with Romney, they are unhappy with Boehner and McConnell. They are losing their base of American conservatives. Trump is energizing that base and if more candidates took his approach, they could get conservatives back into the voting booths. Of course CNN, MSNBC, and CBS are going to trash him, they have always been much harder on Republicans than Democrats and anyone denying that is not being intellectually honest. He doesn't care. He's sticking to his guns which is what the Republican base needs.

"Darn typo

Every argument I see, in regards to piracy, is ultimately based in one and one thing only, a selfish desire for a free luxury, one that actively hurts small-time artists (not big corporations). 

I will begin by rebutting common pro-piracy arguments.

1) It doesn't hurt the artist!
Even were this statement true(it's not) it has nothing to do with morality(and thus, the legality) of the issue. It may very well help them, but it is without a doubt true that a pirate violates the owner's property rights, and the elements of the contract they sign.  Ultimately this argument can be ignore, because it is not just for someone to burn down another house just for petty revenge even if the ultimate result is a hefty insurance payment for the victim.
2) It's the freedom of information age!
No, it isn't, since the information isn't free. Information isn't, nor should it be, inherently free. Classified military secrets, passwords, SSNs, browser histories, and credit card numbers are ""information"" but most certainly should not be given for free to anyone and everyone.
3) The poor wouldn't have bought it anyway. Besides, how do you expect me to pay for it?
Another disregarding of morality, but let's address this directly. Information that is pirated, aka games, books, movies, etc. are luxuries. They are not necessities. Thus, while the poor may very well have not bought it anyway, they still violated property rights for something not in any way,shape, or form necessary for their survival or well-being. Stealing food, water, or money in order to purchase the former may, at times, be justified, but the theft of luxuries is not necessary for your survival. 
4) We should transition to donation system.
This is one of the more laughable positions I have seen and so often comes from the exact same people who argue that charity is not enough to help the poor(which they almost always claim they are). That argument, which I agree with, is especially true of art and copyrights. Why do you have to pay the electrician for the work he did to your house? After all, you never took anything from him, all he did was rearrange the bits in your house to work again, something you could of done yourself. All he lost was time, and that's not illegal to take, is it? So then why do we not hear of the same donation systems for blue collar workers like this? Because it's ridiculous.

I am open to discussion on this. I can admit I'm wrong, but I just get infuriated with such selfish attitudes so common among supposed leftists; attitudes that are the catalysts for abominations like SOPA.

IMPORTANT EDIT: I worded ""Largely"" indefeasible deliberately. Like all actions there are some justified exceptions, such as already owning the content, or being unable to access it due to government or corporate interference.

"Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for “sleeping around"", and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise for the same behaviour. 

I want to make this point clear – I am NOT debating whether or not it is good/bad when a woman engages in behavior that is typically defined under the scope of ""slut."" That is another argument altogether. I am only asserting that the difference in reaction the majority of people have when they hear about the sexual exploits of either gender is, in general, justified.

The reason for this, of course, is biological. It is generally imperative for males to propagate their DNA throughout many different potential mates as possible, to ensure the survival of his line. Historically, however, females had to be more restrictive with who they engage in intercourse with, because they were then strapped with the burden of taking care of/raising a child as a product of the encounter. The brains, hormone profiles, and physiology are disparate between the genders to reflect, in part, these differences in motivation.

Given these differences, the crux of my argument boils down to this: it is simply more difficult for a heterosexual man to attain sex, than a woman, ceterus paribus. 

Once again, to be very clear, I'm not making any moral claims about being a slut; I'm simply stating the difference in difficulty in accomplishing the same task, and the justification of the subsequent reaction.

To illustrate this point, I would like to I highlight the scenario of Bob. Bob built a business from the ground up; through sheer hard work and determination, he came from nothing, and now runs a company of hundreds of employees, making millions in revenue.

Now, here is Patrick. Patrick also has a company of hundreds of employees, making million dollars in revenue, through his hard work and determination.

The difference between Bob and Patrick is this – Bob had absolutely zero dollars in his bank account when he started his business, while Patrick inherited over $5 billion from his father's trust fund.

So, even though both have technically accomplished the same thing, it would be fair to say that Bob deserves higher praise. The difference being, of course, while the task itself was the same, the difficulty level of either party to achieve/accomplish this task is significantly different. In the same way, we can assert that (all things being equal) it is much more difficult for a man to sleep with many women, than the reverse.

Now, anticipating potential rebuttals, I would like to highlight other scenarios using the same logic above: I believe that heterosexual men (and homosexual women) deserve more praise than homosexual men for the same acts. To what degree, I'm honestly not sure, as I'm not an expert in biology/sociology of this kind, but using the biological argument for the difficulty of the task, I would say that homosexual men hooking up is generally easier than the other scenarios. I could be wrong on this, but it's more of an ancillary point rather than my main argument.

To make sure that you've been reading all the way down to the bottom, I would really appreciate it if you started your post with any word that rhymes with ""crime.""

Consciousness is most likely a fundamental property of our 
universe, as opposed to only existing after a certain complexity of arrangement of matter which we call sentient beings.

This statement has the implication of announcing plants, virus, rocks, dirt, stars and galaxies as conscious. 

I am aware that given the mysterious nature of consciousness, this is a topic cannot be proven either way. But it is still valid to have opinions and some opinions make more sense than others. This is my current stance on it which is very much up to debate.

These points all contribute to my belief. 

1. The only thing that can be known to be true is that there is such a thing as conscious experience. I cannot know for sure that anyone but me has a conscious experience, but I do know for a fact that I do. 
2. Our consciousness is associated with our brain. Certain part of our brain seems to exert certain conscious properties. Remove that part of the brain and what remains is still consciousness, but with fewer attributes. E.g. this woman who does not feel fear. It's just not part of her experience because her brain lacks that property. Is she less conscious than others? That's up to debate, but I would argue no; she just lacks attributes to her experience.
3. Many have believed that consciousness is contingent upon sensory input. Can a person born without any sensory input whatsoever be conscious? Is there any experience to be had without senses? Maybe. Contemplatory people such as monks say there is. Regardless of what religion they're from - if any at all - they commonly speak of experiences of beyond all senses and feelings, just a state full of nothing which they can come back from and speak about. This proves nothing but it is interesting to think about. 
4. There is nothing about a brain that suggest that consciousness should exist. Scientifically, there is absolutely nothing connecting matter to consciousness. Consciousness is not subject to science at all at the moment. The implications of consciousness is subject to science, such as psychology and just even the act of preforming science. But doing science on consciousness itself is not possible at the moment. This suggest that either consciousness is beyond the scope of science, or that consciousness is remains undiscovered to science for the moment. To argue that certain arrangements of matter spontaneously creates consciousness is not a convincing argument. It makes more sense that all matter in general holds properties of consciousness - not yet discovered -, and certain combinations of matter only increases the complexities of consciousness giving it new attributes. 
5. There are studies out there that suggest that our own consciousness is just a combination of many (infinite?) different consciousnesses. Such as this article describes how consciousnesses can be connected together and multiple beings can share one consciousness of collective knowledge and reasoning. This is not a hypothesis, it actually happens as you can read in the article. 
6. All these points shake the foundation of our intuitive feeling that consciousness is something strong and individual, personal and separate. Consciousnesses can be split to pieces, merged together and is actually very fluid. This all suggests to me that it is much more reasonable to think of consciousness as a fundamental property of our universe, and just like matter looks and behaves differently with different complexities and arrangements, there is all the reason to believe consciousness behaves the same. When we die, the complexities that our consciousness was subject to seize to exist, but the fundamental conscious property is still there.

Those who argue that consciousness only arise after certain  arrangements of matter seem to be claiming something much more profound and illogical than what I proposed. Everything we know about our universe we have been able to boil down to fundamental properties. Why would consciousness act differently? Those who suggest so have the burden of proof, and until we know better it makes more sense to assume that consciousness is a fundamental property of our universe.

"I believe the world would have been better off if Chapo Guzman had been extradited to the US. I understand that there are all kinds of laws surrounding extradition, but ultimately I don't those are relevant because if Guzman had been extradited to the US, he would have been kept in the more secure and less corrupt environment. His chances of escaping would have been much much lower.

That man is responsible for a huge part of the recent drug wars in Mexico. He is indirectly responsible for thousands of deaths. The fact that he is out there and out of the reach of the law is a massive let down to the people of Mexico and ultimately the world. 

Maybe the drug wars were partially caused by business opportunities created by drug policies in the US. But that's irrelevant. El Chapo is an evil man who deserves to be in prison, hands down.

The refusal of the Mexican government to extradite him makes the world worse off, as there is one more big time criminal who is not being brought to justice. Please CMV.

I'm sorry, but male and female sports athletes can't be compared.

Any of the top 50-150 male ATP players would beat her 9.5 out of 10 times, there are huge differences in the sport.

1. The average serve for at the 2015 Wimbledon Finals for a Female(I saw the stat during a Semi-Final game) was 94MPH while the males was 124MPH. That's a huge difference, the fastest ever female serve was 131 while the males fastest serve was 163MPH, Cilic, Groth, Karlovic, Raonic, and Roddick all of those players average first serve is above 124MPH.

2. Females play best to 2 sets and men play best to 3 sets

3. It was tested in Battle of the sexes tennis game where Bobby Riggs(Former number 1) at age 55 played 30 year old Margrett Court(Ranked 1 at the time) and she lost in straight sets. Note he latter played King age 26 who beat him at age 56,(He couldn't get any drop shots, but still forced a 3rd set.)

4. Serrnia said in 1998 at the age of 16 that she could beat and male under 200, Karsten Braash responded ranked 203 that he would play her, and she accepted and lost (6,1 6,1)(Note: She won the US open in 1999). Venus then challenged him and lost (6,2)(6,2).

Baraash said he played like a 600th ranked player to keep the game fun.


Also the whole Female World Cup players should be paid the same is total BS in my opinion for two reasons

1. The Female World Cup was projected to bring in 26M viewers while the Male World Cup brought in 800M-1B people(Note: That some countries don't have good reporting standards so the numbers are off.)

2. The Female World Cup brought in $40M Ad revenue while the 2015 male World Cup brought in $4B which is 100x more and thats why the Mens side is paid more.

In my opinion its insulting to women to pay them the same as the male tournament if they didn't earn it.

If they want the same tournament winnings they should be advocating for a single tournament not two different tournaments. The same with Tennis if you want to compare Serrna to the male version you should be pushing for a single tournament.

"A multitude of films have twists in the plot, for example Gone Girl, Memento, a lot of films of M. Night Shyamalan, the Usual Suspects, Shutter Island, Fight club, well I can go on and on. Here is a list of 100 twists. 

It usually consists of a plot that advances, but with hidden information not completely revealed yet. When the information is revealed, it will heighten the liking of the plot. It feels 'Mind blowing', the movie instantly goes deeper, it is suddenly a more complex movie, and twists are ideal for deep analysis and allegories. 

Adding a twist to a plot can make it everyone say 'Wow' and that one guy say: 'I knew it all along'. 

I think an analogy of showing why people like this so much, because it is abit like being in the plato's cave and then suddenly showing the light and deeper meaning. 

However, and this is my point, it is a simple and cheap way to make the movie much smarter than it initially was. I think there is also a high amount of plot twist movies in the IMDB top 250 (By no means a standard, but a good representative what is liked by movie-goers). Adding a well written plot twist makes a movie ripe for people to laud it, even though it is done to dead.

Basically my point is that it is a too simple way to make a movie 'smarter' and an overdone method of 'blowing peoples minds'. It instantly adds points for movie-goers. 

As I said in the title, my point is not that is a non-amusing 'plot device'. But it is a simple way to add layers in a movie. 

While watching a movie myself I always seem to like a twist (I thought Gone Girl did this very well and it sincerely surprised me) but afterwards when I am out of the cinema and more rational again I think 'hmm, just another twistmovie'. And apart from the twist nothing really interesting going on.

A well regarded movie where I didn't like the twist was 'The Usual Suspects'. The cinematography and acting was obviously well done, but only looking at the plot I thought it wasn't impressive taking away the twist. I am probably triggering now a couple readers, for that I am sorry. However this is not a critique of this movie, but more of an example.

I also think this is the reason why M. Night Shyamalan was so well recieved in the start of his career and now he is way less regarded than at that time. Because he does it all the time, and then it surfaces that it is a cheap movie 'plot device'. If he did it only once or twice people wouldn't have noticed it significantly.

"I think the real reason people punish others for transgressions is not so much to discourage the behavior, but rather to channel humanity's inherently predatory nature in a way that's socially acceptable and does not contradict with the moral values we have invented (or discovered, depending on how you look at it).

Most people feel a smug sense of satisfaction if they hear about a bully being beat up, or a murderer being executed by the state. Humans, being predatory creatures, have a certain sense of bloodlust and channeling this predatory instinct towards people who are predatory allows them to continue to view themselves as not being predators, while still enjoying violence.

Even bullies often justify their torments of victims as a form of punishment for not fitting the social norms, being ""annoying"" or acting in a way that is in their eyes unacceptable. Serial killers also often see their acts as a sort of punishment towards humanity. Rapists are often motivated by a desire to punish women. It seems like evil deeds are often motivated by a perverted sense of justice rather than mere selfishness or greed.

Another reason I think punishment has more to do with humans enjoying violence than it does with stopping bad behavior is the fact that corporal punishment of children is still very popular and defended by the majority of adults. I always felt like my parents took pleasure in punishing me, so I may be biased, but I really do think parents spank their children more out of anger and frustration than out of a will to help them develop.

Another reason I think it's innate is because the moral goodness of punishment is something virtually everybody agrees on. Liberals and conservatives alike usually have a ""tough on crime"" stance and would rather a violent criminal receive a harsh punishment even if it's more expensive and makes them less likely to be rehabilitated, than a lesser punishment that rehabilitated them more effectively. This sentiment is prevalent in every culture, even in societies like Scandinavia where the laws are more lenient.

We punish people because we perceive them as ""deserving it"" ie, we despise them and lust for their blood because we perceive them as being no longer part of the same species, and something that needs to be predated upon for the benefit of the community.

I actually think if there was no prison or capital punishment it would have very little effect on crime rates. The few people who are truly serial offenders could just be put in hospitals and the rest will eventually be released from prison anyway and will be far crazier on release after spending decades in the pen.

In a nutshell, I think punishment has actually caused far more evil than it's prevented and is really just an outlet for our inherent cruelty as a meat-eating species at the top of the food chain. Punishing people we consider ""bad"" also has the effect of affirming our own self righteousness.

"I believe that people have a moral obligation to donate money they do not need. Full stop.

But the government (specifically that of America) is not in the business of moralizing. The government is established to protect inalienable rights and to allow for fair competition. There are many cases where the government is not doing its job in allowing for fair competition, but I am not speaking about these cases. I'm going to give a few scenarios, and I'd love if someone who disagrees could criticize the conclusions I make.

- There are two pizza delivery companies. One of the company owners, Pablo, spent every night for the past 6 months figuring out how to optimize his business. He found better ways to incubate pizzas, better ways to stack pizzas in his pizza-mobile, and also found better ways to pizza his pizza. Because of this, more people are buying his pizzas. In the next year, Pablo earned three times as much as his competitor. Pablo sends his kids to public school, and has the same amount of kids as his competitor; he goes to the doctor when he is ill, and goes the same amount of times as his competitor; he's an American just like his competitor, and benefits from military defense in the same way; why on Earth would Pablo have to spend multiple times as much money on these things than his competitor? I really don't get it, I'm sorry. They utilize the same services in the same exact way, why is Pablo in essence subsidizing his competitor's payments just because Pablo is a smarter, more efficient businessman?

- There's a marathon going on in Vermont. Two hundred participants compete for the $1,000 given to first, second, and third place. Each participant puts down $20, which goes toward prize money and ensuring the event is run well. Each winner splits the prize money. At the end of the race, the three winners of first, second, and third place are shocked to find out that they are only taking home $120. The event organizers apparently decided that the winners, despite working harder and simply being better at their craft, and despite equally paying for the organization of the event, should have to pay the other participants for simply existing.

I just don't get it. If I drive to work and pass a bridge, I need to pay the toll because bridges cost money. Great. And perhaps I should pay in proportion to how much I drive, that seems like a good idea as well. But if I make a successful website that utilizes none of the services, and in fact very few services at all, is it not plainly theft that a bureaucrat decides where my EARNED money goes? I'd rather donate the money I don't need to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, to environmental causes, to the cure for cancer, but the government seems to be stealing it from me so they can play live-action Battlefield 5: Real Life Edition.

"A common meme among MRAs and the ""pussy pass"" crowd is that whenever a woman hits a man in some way and then gets hit back, it's ""equality"" in action because society sees violence against women as more important than violence against men.  

A shorthand catch phrase that expresses this is ""equal rights, equal lefts"" which implies that if women want to be treated equally they should expect to be hit back if they hit someone else.  

I disagree that this is about equality at all.  

1) Overwhelmingly, in cases where this concept is used on reddit, the man used disproportionate violence. See this thread for an example: https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3chyco/fsu_quarterback_is_filmed_punching_a_woman_in_the/  

Most of the upvoted comments in the linked /r/news thread stated she had it coming and that it was equality for her to be hit. But if you actually watch the video she hardly posed a threat to him, and all she did was weakly hit him. Then he lobbed a punch that knocked her flat  

2) The stronger/larger person should show self restraint. Many of the same people who argue in favor of this phrase are also the same people who constantly argue about the physical differences between men and women. Is it not then hypocritical to expect fair fights?   

3) I think all you need to do is check out how much people revel in women ""getting their comeuppance"" in these fight videos to see that they enjoy watching women get beat as if they always expect not to get hit back (ie. ""using their pussy pass"") when in fact I've rarely if ever seen videos where women are shown saying or expecting that.  

---

edit: since a lot of this discussion has centered around self-defense, I would like to link this Sam Harris article on de-escalating violence. I don't think we should be celebrating fights that start from either party escalating it further  

edit 2: Not sure if this is relevant, but what brought this up is this: My concern is that whenever I see those kinds of comments, people claim that they're just interested in equality. But that doesn't sound right to me because of how 1) the fight is usually so one-sided, 2) you usually can't even show that the woman was using her ""pussy pass"", 3) I don't see much evidence that women by and large even think they can get away with violence because of their gender

"I'm European (England), as a result I've been watching the Greece situation unfold quite ardently.

It is my view that spending within your means is a moral obligation, regardless if its personal finance or government spending. Therefor I see the tactics employed by Tsipras and his party as cynical at best and downright reckless at worst - it's essentially been an effort to blackmail the Eurozone. As a result of this, I have sympathy for the Greek people as they will bare the brunt of the consequences from all this, but admittedly my sympathy is quite limited as they voted quite overwhelmingly in favour of supporting Tsipras when it was quite clear what could happen.

At the time of the referendum there were rallies in Scotland to support the 'No' vote, as well as France. These are areas with a very heavy left-leaning population (the SNP in particular in Scotland were also convinced that anti-austerity would work). Coupled with this, on Reddit I've seen a lot of people arguing that it is in fact not Greece's fault and the blame should be placed upon the lenders.

Obviously I do not agree with this standpoint as it paints Greece as some kind of foolish child who has no ability to look after itself. All this got me thinking - it is my view that those shifting the blame away from Greece do so to save face in the fact that the traditional left wing idea they may hold close - that of anti-austerity - has clearly not worked and instead has made things much, much worse.

I believe that Greece's situation represents defeat for the anti-austerity platform as a whole and the left wing ideals it represents.

EDIT:  I'll add this since I'm getting a lot of advice to get off twitter.  I definitely don't go on as much as I used to, but it's hard for me to stay off completely for two reasons.  One, there's a lot of actually good, funny twitterers out there.  It's also a good news source, it's how I found out we got Bin Laden.  Two, as someone who, despite all warning signs, wants to be involved someday in the comedy/entertainment biz, it's kinda necessary for those on the come up to use it as a promotional tool.  If I was Spielberg or Tarantino I'd get the hell off, trust me.  But I'm a nobody from nowhere at the moment.

Try not to focus on the Twitter thing as much.  There's pieces on Gawker, WaPo and Daily Dot that I've used for examples.  Here's a piece on the AVClub where the writer complains about female fans of Captain Marvel for... reasons.  Not sure.  They're problematic somehow.

I think those two, and there are others, are also worthy of discussion in that they involve nuance.  Someone like Donald Trump, that's a black-and-white case of racism.  

Someone in the comments said this seemed like neurotic hand-wringing by an alienated individual, and that could very well be the case.  I didn't really spend a whole lot of time making a comprehensive essay about this because a-it's just reddit and b-I posted from the gut with immediacy.

"So the most popular non-religious argument against beastiality is that such actions are wrong because it is impossible to get any kind of consent. I think it is possible to argue otherwise (for some animals it is very easy to read their emotional state), but I won't argue that because I think the whole idea that consent would be necessary in these situations is completely inconsistent with how animals are treated by the vast majority of our population, including vegetarians.

Example 1(for the vegetarians, but applicable for everyone): Pet ownership. Do we get consent when we take a puppy from his parents? Do we get consent when we neuter them? If you assume that consent is essential in animal/human relationships, pet ownership itself becomes a kind of slavery or imprisonment. The owner provides food and housing, the pet is imprisoned and provides entertainment to the owner. Any argument you could run about this being justifiable without consent would frighteningly similar to arguments for why slavery in the U.S. was good for many of the slaves. Arguments that they ""seem happy,"" or ""they don't run away"" are meaningless when you have kidnapped an animal and brought it up to be dependent on you. I'm not saying pet ownership IS slavery; I'm saying that the only way it pet ownership can be justified is if you toss out the idea of needing consent for our interactions with animals.

Example 2(for the carnivores): The vast majority of human beings eat animals. If you are one of this majority, the idea that you would ask an animals consent for anything is laughable. You could argue that unnecessary cruelty is still wrong, but much beastiality clearly involves the pleasuring of the animal, not the torturing of it. And regardless, arguments against cruelty have nothing to do with ""consent.""

So that's my basic argument. Come on reddit, change my view!

Edit: Changed zoophillia to beastility since zoophillia does not necessarily involve actual sex with animals. 

Edit 2: Just to clarify, I think bestiality is both disgusting and morally wrong. I think that cruelty to animals is wrong. This CMV is not ""convince me that bestiality is wrong"" or ""convince me that bestiality hurts animals""; it is ""convince me that consent is a relevant concept when applied to animals.""

"This is an adequate example of what I am talking about in terms of overly severe sentencing, however i'd love the discussion to be less about sentencing and more about societal judgement. As an example, of course she should never work in education again, but holy shit she shouldn't be rotting away for what is essentially a third of her life just for making 3 people extremely happy. 

Why I think this:

I'm a 27 year old male with a perfectly normal upbringing, a healthy sex life and in a healthy relationship of over 2 years. 

There is nothing I wouldn't have done to get the chance to be intimate with one of my female teachers starting from year 5 right up to university. In my teen years, regardless of losing my virginity at 14 to my then 13 year old girlfriend, I was still completely infatuated with every mildly attractive person I encountered. I was a ball of hormonal clarity, not confusion, I wanted sex, and that was the extent of it. Whereas I feel women as a gender are not as predisposed to hormonal imperatives, so the base need for women does not exist anywhere close to the need that an adolescent man has to get the job done. 

TLDR: Adult male vs teenage female, not OK, they're not as into it as men, and the act itself is being driven by a pretty gross desire to bang someone, which they've then chosen to act upon a teenaged girl.

"In short, college students are absolute fools, and by and large deserve no pity for their stupidity. I understand what I’m saying is very contentious but allow me to try and explain without sounding like an arrogant jerk (I’ll fail, but whatever). One of the most frustrating things I see in the news is the ridiculous debate over “rape-culture” on college campuses as if they’re full of malicious serial rapists and murderers. Now, I’ll admit I am a member of a large social fraternity at my school, a highly ranked university in California with ~40,000 students, so let the bias be noted. I want to first point out that this “debate” is absurd, there is an imaginary opposition to the idea that rape and rape-culture is bad. You won’t find rallies supporting rape or anyone (of course a few but exceptionally rare) suggesting that rape is acceptable. What the debate clearly stems from is the idea that rape and sexual assault is some liquid term with varying boundaries. A man having sex with a drunk girl is considered rape by some people and to be fine by others. Those saying it is rape see the opposition as suggesting any drunk girl is conscientious “asking for it” and likewise those saying it is normal see the other side as suggesting being drunk rids you of responsibility for your actions. This creates an intense debate despite the fact that they all agree on the same fundamental principle. 
	
With that out of the way, let’s talk about the behavior of college students. As I said before I am in a fraternity and the ridiculous nonsense I see every week of the school year is beginning to weigh on me. I have seen a girl give head on a dancefloor in our house surrounded by hundreds of people, I have been assaulted by random guys drunk as hell, I have had to physically remove several guys because they’re pissing in the corner of a room. Of course, we’re totally asking for all of this I suppose is the first thing that comes to most people’s minds. We throw parties, we supply alcohol, we play the music and turn on the blacklights. Who am I to look down upon the result of my creation? And the answer is that I don’t, if I didn’t enjoy it I wouldn’t be taking part in it. What bothers me however is the incredible entitlement and utter lack of dignity these people have. That girl I saw railing a line of coke and pounding away 3 shots out of a plastic handle? Oh it’s her life, who are you to judge! That guy shattering a window on the second floor? Oh you shouldn’t have given him alcohol, shame on you for throwing an unsafe party. 
	
What I have come to realize is that most students are absolute idiots, at least on the weekends. One caveat, yes I may just be around the wrong crowds, but I would say with complete confidence that at least a third of the student body engages in the type of idiotic garbage I’m talking about. How does this relate to rape? If it isn’t obvious, it is because I end up being the victim. These attitudes and opinions sincerely make me scared to have sex with a girl, because I know just being in a fraternity will make me guilty of rape before I can even open my mouth to defend myself. I find it unbelievable that there is such a stigma against, let’s be honest, men in college. I have to hear about it all day, how dangerous it is to go to a fraternity party, how you’ll get drugged and taken advantage of. Well let me tell you a vast majority of the girls found in these places will drug themselves before any guy even gets the chance. I see girls get black-out drunk and fk anyone that looks their direction every other weekend and I ask myself, “is this the same type of girl I see ranting and raving that just because she was drunk means she didn’t consent?” It is becoming increasingly hard for me to believe that they aren’t one in the same. Okay, okay I’ve been too anti-female, but believe me I think the guys are just as bad. I have heard of six people getting DUIs in my four years here in college. SIX DUIs, and a few drug related charges. What makes these people think this is acceptable is beyond me, but at least they will reap what they sow, I suppose.
	
This has probably been hard to follow, but I can sum it up pretty simply. While I’m sure plenty are sincere, and my heart goes out to them, I find so many self-victimizing claims of college students to be farcical. At this point I just don’t feel pity for the kid next to me in class facing a jail sentence for drug possession, or the girl freaking out because she is now known as the girl who banged five guys on the roof in one night. 

Beyond having pity I’m angered by the fact these poor decisions end up being blamed on me. Let it be known to the world, because surprisingly no one seems to understand this, your university knows EXACTLY what happens at fraternity houses and they support it. They know underage drinking is everywhere they know the drugs are there. They know several of the fraternities “haze” and simply do not care. The police department knows as well, do you think they are ignorant of the massive weekly house parties? Knowing all of this and with absolute agency to stop these organizations from existing they allow it, because universities see the benefit in the greek system for promoting social events for students. Despite this, even if we don’t serve alcohol at a party if some idiot comes drunk we’re going down. We aren’t offered the fair treatment bars or venues receive even though we serve the same function. The system basically works like this: The university knows well of all activities and events and they allow them while publicly stating they are against underage drinking, hazing, and the like. But if or when something goes wrong like let’s say someone gets alcohol poisoning, the university and police department come crashing down on the organizations they support to save face and place all blame on the members. My reputation and life is under threat because I participate in something innocuous that is constantly scapegoated.

"Bar soap is all you need.

And you dont wash your hair at all, you just rinse it. 

Sometimes I use shampoo, maybe once in a month or two, if I did something specially dirty or got chemicals in my hair etc. But your hair is healthier without it, and if I cared enough to find an alternative I would use something natural.

If you quit using shampoo, your hair might be greasy for the first couple days, but with nothing but proper rinsing your hair will be able to clean itself.

Face wash is unnecessary as well. Bar soap is fine. Special body washes are unnecessary. It is all a marketing ploy.

"I swear I'm not a troll. I""m honestly confused. 

I understand the concept of 'privilege' but I don't understand where it is heading. I listen to the countless videos, comics and messages that usually go along the lines of: 

""my neighbour won't go to college because of his fathers drug problem. I will go because my father saved up for my tuition. I have privilege.""

or insert whatever subject you want into that. 

So I get the concept. BUT what I don't understand is where to go from there. 

Some of the privileges that people attribute can't have anything done about them. Others are just who I am. 

Lets take the famous 'white privilege'. (which I am. OH GAWD NO) I can't help but relate it to my christian upbringing where it was beaten (figuratively) into me that 'you were born with sin and must apologize for it! Seek redemption!' 

What good does shame help in any situation? How about pointing at the disadvantaged and say 'lets help them!' Instead of pointing at you and saying 'you better acknowledge that you're white/a sinner/privileged! FEEL BAD FOR IT.'

...I'm rambling. I guess. 

I'm not an activist person. I don't go to rallies. I think I just have problems with someone having a hate laced finger pointed at me for existing if I'm not going out of my way to do something. If my sin is existing, then I don't see what progress you are trying to make by just shaming me about it. Religion/race/whatever the subject of it.

"Something I see come up a lot in music discussion threads, whether on Sputnik Music , /r/Music, or even a more niche sub like /r/PostHardcore, is that being very specific with genres is an annoying thing. This is an especially large joke in extreme metal discussions where there are multitudes of different sub-genres.

I think these are great. If you like a band with a specific sound and you want to find more bands like them your best bet is to search for bands in the same genre. Being vague or broad with genres is a great way to not find more bands like the ones you're looking for.

For example, say I like Protest the Hero and want to find more bands like them. They have a lot of influences in their style but could be chalked up into the umbrella genre of ""metal."" If I search ""metal"" I will get a ton of bands that sound absolutely nothing like Protest the Hero. Even narrowing it down to ""Progressive Metal"" still gets a lot of bands that aren't very similar, like Opeth. But if I search for ""Mathcore"" which is a lot more specific I can find bands that sound a lot like them.

There's no reason for the disdain of genres. No one complains about when movies get a million genre tags (Example but when bands do they get annoyed and I can't see why.

Ed Lee's continued policy of making San Francisco a sanctuary for illegal immigrants by not cooperating with federal law enforcement led to the release of Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez. Therefore he is culpable for the murder he committed because without Lee's policy Kate would still be alive. I believe just as the Obama administration went after the state of Arizona for trying to enforce immigration law they should go after Lee for not enforcing it. In fact if it's with in the law Lee and any one else involved in Sanchez release should be charged with abetting a felon. At the very least the federal government should cut all  funding from the city until they comply with immigration law.,{'he'}
"I’m a guy and I would say I agree with some aspects of the feminist movement, but other aspects I find silly/trivial. I’m currently dating a girl who is a VERY strong feminist. Over the weekend we were playing Mario Kart 64 and for as long as I can remember my go to character for Nintendo games has been Peach. There’s really no particular reason I do this other than I seem to do the best with Peach.

When I won the grand prix my girlfriend said “Ugh, I hate Peach, she’s such a weak and stereotypical female video game character.” To which I jokingly replied “Wow, that’s a SUPER sexist thing to say, and she’s obviously not that weak since I crushed you with her.” And her response to that was “Peach negatively reinforces the idea that women are weak and can only be saved by men in power like Mario.”

Then I made the mistake of saying “Well I don’t think that’s true.” We ended up getting into an argument over the portrayal of females in video games and how that perpetuates stereotypes in the real world. Her main argument was that most females in video games are portrayed as weak and need help from the male characters and this is detrimental to women in real life.

There were two issues I had with her argument, the first one being that there are a TON of badass female characters in video games who don’t need no man: Samus, Rosalina, Zelda/Sheik, Palutena, Bayonetta, Lara Croft, Ellie from the last of us, and GLaDOS (just to get a female villain in there). She shrugged this off by saying it’s still not enough because male protagonist characters outnumber female characters in video games. I feel like she wouldn’t be happy unless the numbers of male and female characters are exactly equal.

The second, and main issue I had with her argument is even if all female characters were represented as weak and helpless, I sincerely doubt there is any correlation between these characters and real world issues for women. For me video games are make believe, fiction, and stories. They’re imaginary worlds with imaginary characters. Saying the portrayal of women in video games perpetuates real societal problems for women (like pay inequality) is about as absurd to me as saying violence in video games perpetuates violence in real life, which from what I can tell has been thoroughly debunked. Most reasonable people realize that women don’t wear bright pink dresses, pick vegetables with faces out of the ground, and get kidnapped from a giant turtle/dinosaur hybrid.

I provided my argument, and also said if Mario’s and Peach’s roles were reversed I could seriously not care less, as long as the game was still fun. Her response was “You won’t ever understand because you’re a guy.” I tried to continue on the debate but was met with the same response every time: “You won’t ever understand because you’re a guy.”

So here I am trying to change my view, while I may not agree with the feminist issue of women in video games, I feel like I’m more empathetic than what my girlfriend is giving me credit for. Have there been studies done about the portrayal of women in video games/stories and their effects on society? Is there any hard evidence for this correlation? 

EDIT: Yes, I get it, some people's feelings are hurt that Princess Peach is portrayed the way she is, and while making people upset IS a negative effect, this is not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for more of an impact than ""It's bad cause ma feelings are hurt""

"Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between rich and poor, in fact there are no poor and rich. However previous experiments have shown that it just does not work due to the key concept Marx himself proposed, that in order for socialism to work, the whole world has to be socialist. In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed. The counter argument would be that these states were authoritarian and never really had socialism. However that is the very issue, which I have with socialism, due to two reasons:

First, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally. That is the very reason why it later turned into a terrible state like Soviet Union, where there were no true elections anymore, corruption was high and some were “more equal than the others”. Meaning it was not the authoritarian state, which was the cause of the failure of socialism, but people’s inability to follow socialist rules, which led to the failure of the USSR in the 90s, whose system was heavily relied on Oil prices and the economy was otherwise weak. 

Second of all, as mentioned before, in order for Socialism to work, the whole world has to comply with it. If for example say USA will start implementing even minor socialists norms, then other countries like China, where there is no free health care or free anything for that matter, will simply out perfume costly workers of USA and take away their jobs. Which is indeed the case with things like outsourcing and not so quickly growing USA economy. The solution for USA would then be to close itself up and live in a world where there are no imports or exports, this would protect its citizens from fierce external competition, but leave USA lacking behind in progress of all kinds. Examples for this are Venezuela or Columbia. 

All in all, I still think that some elements of socialist systems are useful, like welfare for people who recently lost their jobs, paid mothers leave etc. However this are minor elements, which I think, should otherwise be implemented in fierce Capitalist society, where in order to succeed you cannot rely on gov. support, but 95 % on yourself.

Edit: I hope this is not too long of an explanation.

"Bernie Sanders is running a campaign on promises like free college and getting money out of politics. Nearly everything I've heard his campaign promise requires congressional action. As a congressman Bernie Sanders knows that.

From the Huffington Post : ""Among the specific items on his campaign platform include establishing a $15 minimum wage, closing the gender pay gap, investing $1 trillion over five years to rebuild infrastructure, and overturning the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision""

Each of those things requires new legislation. With 16 years in the House and 2 terms in the Senate Sanders should be familiar with the limits of each branch of government. This makes me think he knows he can't win so he is recklessly promising absurd things. When he inevitably loses and the winning candidate fails to deliver on the impossible goals he set out he can say ""I would have done it differently"" but we should know better. Even if he wins, he'll blame Congress for blocking his agenda. The only way he can possibly accomplish anything he promises is if 1) He wins the presidential election, 2) Like-minded democrats win a majority in BOTH houses of congress.

"Hey /cmv/, I expect this to be a doozy.

Basically, I see people complaining all the time about the media and their 'unrealistic standards' for beauty.  And I get that the magazines will take models and photoshop the hell out of them.  Okay, of course you can't photoshop yourself like a magazine ad in real life.

But go on Instagram right now and check out some of the girls on there.  And I'm not talking about the professional models who use photoshop, I'm talking about the college girls who get ~~HUGE~~ relatively large followings and tons of 'likes' because they are drop dead gorgeous.  The only thing they are using to adjust their pictures are Instagram filters.

I personally am friends with some of these girls, and they are just as drop dead gorgeous in real life as they are in their photos. Hell, in my opinion these girls look better than the photoshopped ads!

As a result, I don't believe there are unrealistic standards for women to be beautiful, because I see regular girls reach those standards all the time.  

If you are a guy or a girl and want to be more attractive, it's very simple.  Hit the gym, dress well. Done.  Congratulations, you have achieved the 'unrealistic' beauty standard.  

To me, it seems that most people who are complaining about these unattainable standards just don't want to put the time and effort needed to look good.  And hell, I'm one of them! I'm not super jacked or anything. But I acknowledge this is my fault, so I shouldn't feel bad when all the guys in the ads are way better looking than I am.

"I should caveat that I'm talking about these terms as applied to humans --  not plants, nonhuman animals, or electronic devices. 

And by ""socially-sanctioned,"" I mean a definition broadly acceptable to the PC mainstream, such that you could print it in the OpEd section of the NYT without major media or social-media backlash.

The OED definitions, while coherent, are trans-exclusionary and therefore not socially sanctioned:

female (adjective)  Of or denoting the sex that can bear offspring or produce eggs, distinguished biologically by the production of gametes (ova) that can be fertilized by male gametes.

So maybe there's a socially-sanctioned definition of ""male"" or ""female"" which doesn't reference anatomy?  If you can think of one, you may CMV. 

Citing studies less compelling/conclusive than mythologized by redditors, you might respond that ""male"" and ""female"" refer to the innate biology of the brain, not the body.

"Financial abortion, aka legal paternal surrender, is a concept talked about among Men's Rights groups whereby they believe men should be allowed to opt out of paying child support. This process would occur sometime after the woman is aware she's pregnant and notifies the man, and then MRAs believe he should be able to sign himself out of being the father if he desires (losing all the other rights of fatherhood like visitation, of course).  

MRAs state that this gives a right to men that they lack in comparison to women, namely that women can choose whether or not they want to be a parent either by carrying the fetus to term or having an abortion.  

I'm not going to argue that point here, as that's been done a million times over. I'm going to say for the sake of this post that I'll agree that men should have this right, BUT:  

Only if we also create a social safety net to help cover the funds needed for the child to have a good life. Funds that would otherwise have been paid for by the father.  

According to the UN, children have specific rights that the state must see to. The state has to make choices in the best interest of the child. If we're depriving the child of an income source, then the state has to see to it that the child is taken care of.   

The best way the state can do that if the father opts out of paying is to make up for it themselves through welfare.  

---  

I'm going to anticipate some responses that I want to address. Yes, if a woman can't alone support a child financially, then knowing the father will opt out, she should not go through with having the child. However, it is her choice and her right to do so. I believe that people should be allowed to exercise control over their own body.  

Once the baby is born it must be taken care of. (Trying to convince me that we shouldn't care about babies and just let them die if the mother is irresponsible will not work, sorry, I can't be that heartless.)

Also, just telling the mother to get a second job or work even more and find more income is flawed in my view, because poor single mothers probably can't take on many more responsibilities with affecting the child's life in a detrimental way.

"People always talk about how rich people (i.e. mega-millionaires and billionaires) are not paying their ""fair share"" in terms of income taxes. They say how the tax rate for the rich should not be smaller than the tax rate for those who are not rich. But even if there is a great disparity in tax RATES, the AMOUNT of taxes that a mega-millionaire or billionaire has to pay is still greater than the average person's. For example, an income tax rate of 10% on a person making 10 million dollars a year means that that person would have to pay 1 million dollars in taxes, but an income tax rate of 30% on a person making 100,000 dollars a year means that that person would have to pay 30,000 dollars. Even though the millionaire has a lower tax rate, it's not fair that he/she has to pay 1 million dollars in taxes while another person only has to pay 30,000 dollars. There shouldn't be a penalty in the form of tax for people who make a lot of money; it's simply not fair. It's also not democratic because while each person only gets one vote, the richer person gets a greater financial obligation to society than the average person.

Hi everyone! I went to the zoo with the SO yesterday (both in our mid 20's) and the amount of babies there (children under 1.5 years old abouts) was incredible. They're howling all over the place which is a no-no for most zoo patrons as it disturbs and can scare the wildlife. Why the fuck would you bother not only the other zoo patrons but the animal wildlife by bringing an infant in a place they can't comprehend or remember? I had finally had enough at the chimpanzee habitat when a baby in a stroller started screaming his head off which totally freaked out all the chimps. Chaos ensued within the habitat. It's just disrespectful for everyone involved. 

EDIT: I'm going to highlight that this is not about generalized babies crying in public spaces. This is very specific. If you have an infant, what is your thought process on not moving away from an animal enclosure when your child is screaming, disturbing the animals, and there are signs everywhere that say ""NO LOUD NOISES"". 

TL;DR babies screaming at a restaurant is a-ok in my book. Babies screaming, freaking out animals in a ""Quiet Zone"" and not being removed from the premises is most assuredly not a-ok. ",{'his'}
"I'm seeing a lot of heat against FIFA because of the unequal pay distributed to US woman soccer players compared to men. (See this article for more info: http://www.cnbc.com/id/102811922) 

Now, while I agree that pay gaps are a problem in ~~general~~ some fields, sports is a different ballgame (no pun intended). As such, the success of a franchise is dependent on the supporters who pay money for tickets, gear, etc. If we were to look at attendance figures for the National Woman's Soccer League (NWSL) for 2014 compared to Major League Soccer (MLS), we see a huge disparity in people attending games. 

Of course, this translates over to other leagues. The NBA draws more people than the WNBA, both live and TV ratings. The revenue of the NFL is exponentially greater than the Independent Woman's Football League. 

I'm not here to provide solutions to this, or look into why the mentality of America draws more into guy sports. Yes, I think that ladies should be paid equally. ~~I also think ladies have the ability to play all sports as good as men do, if not better.~~ And of course, ladies have as much of a right to play in any sport and play it professionally.

"I was listening to Radiolab's podcast entitled ""Eye in the Sky"" which details the work of Ross McNutt and the technology he developed originally to use in Iraq in 2004-5. The project had a silent aircraft flying around a particular city that was prone to bombing, and the aircraft would take photos of the city all day. If a bomb went off, we were able to look back at that area to find who planted the bomb, and then follow that person or group to wherever they ended up in order to arrest them. The technology was also used in Juares to solve the crime of a murdered police officer, and eventually led to a major break in arresting cartel leaders who were responsible for thousands of deaths in the city. Basically this is surveillance technology that could potentially solve crimes and save lives.
The speakers on the podcast were mostly against using this kind of technology, and it seems to be the majority viewpoint. Their only argument seemed to be that it ""felt wrong"" and that they would lose privacy if there was an aircraft flying around the city taking photos, and that terrible things could happen if that information was placed into the wrong hands.

I understand 'intelligence' is a very murky word and everyone thinks they are intelligent, but in the general 'competency of life' sense of the word, if you are unable to hold down a good enough job that money is an ever present problem in your life, I question your intelligence.

Now would be a good time to exclude a few groups:

- Those who have a low income now, but are pretty confident in their ability to hit that threshold in a few years (think grad student).

- Very handy(?might not be the right word?) people, (I have a friend whose dad built an extension on his house, that's as good as money.)

- Those who could easily make a decent salary, but conciously decided that their life would be better if they made a lot less money (I have a friend that chose to work for a non-profit after receiving an engineering offer)

"Hi guys! So, I'm planning on getting sterilized soon. The only reason I haven't started doctor shopping yet is because insurance hasn't kicked in. ACA currently covers all female sterilization. And I want to get it done for a variety of reasons. One being that I don't know for how long it will be covered. Especially once Obama is out of office. Since it's under the initiative he made. And also, I've wanted to get sterilized ever since I found out my mom got her tubes tied after my brother.

She was in a lot of pain since then, and blames the surgery. But. She's been feeling better lately ever since she's been treated for her depression. So who knows. Anyway, I've never liked the tubal ligation procedure, but found out about a year ago a whole world of options! Since I'm planning on making a permanent decision.

I am a very rational person, and only make emotional decisions when it comes to friends and romantic partnerships. But even then, there are logical undertones for choosing these people to enjoy in my life. The point is. Deciding to not have kids is a logical decision for me. I sucked at babysitting growing up. I like entertaining kids, just not taking care of them.

I have never felt that ""maternal urge"". I was beyond relieved as a kid when I found out you didn't have to have kids!

"Ads are everywhere. TV, Radio, Billboards, Movies, etc.  But they add any value to society, IMO all the man-hours spent on advertising are lost, like digging a big hole in the forest and then filling it back in, just for the sake of creating jobs.

The only possible positive thing I can see about advertising is that it may inform a customer about a product that he may need  and did not know about. But this seems to be a flimsy justification at best.

Of course, you could argue the practical limits and problematics of abolishing the advertising industry, but I'm not asking about that, but about the ""morality"", for lack of a better word, of advertising.

EDIT: The counterarguments mostly boil down to ""advertising is good because it informs the customer"" ""if advertising were not there you would have to pay for a lot of services like youtube, TV"" ""limiting advertisement is limiting free speech""

I don't agree with any of the three points above. I am sorry that I don't have more timeto discuss this individidually with every one of you, but my views are:

 Advertising isn't good because it informs the customer what product exists. That is a ridiculously unfair and unefficient system of informing the customer which products exist. It is not  fair that some products inform more people of their existence because they can shell out more money on ads. I believe a better system could be implemented.

 Saying that you would have to pay for currently free services is not true too. You ARE paying them, with your time, by watching ads. And your time watching ads is DEFINITELY less valuable than 8$ per hour, which is min wage. So, it is much more efficient to pay for these services by selling your time to McDonalds/your current employer.

 Limiting advertisement is limiting free speech. This one is less clear. You can argue that limiting advertisement is limiting the actions of individuals and thus limiting free speech. On the other hand, by limiting the speech of big companies, we are making the speech of small companies louder, which IMO increases overall ""free speech"". Regardless, I have a utilitarianistic worldview, and so I don't really care much about limiting free speech if it provides more value to society as a whole.

"So this is an opinion I've had for a while, but after a recent bout of returning to watching certain news stations, it has been grinding my gears particularly of late. To me it seems that any tragic event which is deemed worthy to be broadcasted semi-nationally to nationally becomes fodder for both sides of the political spectrum to either smear the opposition or further their own agenda to a point of being disrespectful of those involved. For example: (And if there is more to this story then I apologize but I am basing what I know on what the common man sees in the news) the recent San Fransisco murder by the 6-time deported criminal. Yes I can understand how this would be a call to repair larger issues, but what I have seen so far has been nothing more than democrats pointing fingers at republicans to cover their tracks and republicans pointing fingers at the democrats to further their own agenda. All the pointing happened almost immediately after Donald Trump's immigration opinion controversy so the events wound up being the perfect fuel for fires. To me this it has almost been disgustingly disrespectful to the victim and her family to have been blasted on the news and using their tragedy to further political agendas. Along with values of disrespect, instead of actually addressing the issues at hand and working to form a solution to actually fix the issues at hand, both sides are so caught up in their own hot air that they refuse to work together and are actually being a detriment to any positive progress.

"Today marks the 10th anniversary of the 7/7 bombings in London. To commemorate this there has been a supposedly nation wide minute silence. While I wouldn't interrupt a minute silence I do think that they are arbitrary and not a good way of ""showing respect"".

Usually they are touted as a way of remembering victims of tragedies, however as someone who lives across the country, I do not know the victims or any of their family and as a result other than the circumstances in which it happened, their deaths have little to no effect on my life. Because of this, I think it is disingenuous and borderline offensive to those close to the victims for me to pretend that I am actively upset by their deaths.

In addition to this I said that minute silences are arbitrary; millions of people have died in  the ten years since, some of them in similar circumstances even yet 99.9% of those will go "" unremembered "". Surely by not holding a minute silence for at least the people who died in terror attacks we are tacitly implying disrespect? One could argue that it should be something carried out only in the home country of the victims which would not explain why the whole world continues to hold minute silences to commemorate 9/11.

I am not saying that there should be a blanket ban on minute silences however. For example it recently made the news that there was a minute silence in the stadium before a football game to acknowledge the death of a fan. I wholeheartedly support that as it shows a community (either his literal, local community or the community of football fans) coming together to show solidarity for someone who's death may well have personally affected many of them.

"I decided to write this here because it's hard to have this discussion anywhere on reddit without getting low effort, kneejerk responses like: ""found the vegan"" and ""for whatever animal you don't eat, I'll eat three!"" If you're going to write that type of response... please don't. 


I'll also preface this by saying that I've been a vegetarian for more than a decade. I know how off putting a preachy vegetarian can be as I know a few (in my experience the preachiest ones are usually the ones that have been vegetarian for a short amount of time or the ones that take to veganism with a religious fervour), but I will be respectful and hope my arguments are judged only on their merits. To start off: 


1. I don't judge meat eaters or push people to stop eating meat altogether, but I am open to discussing vegetarianism with people who ask. 

2. I don't expect the entire world to stop eating meat, all I'm asking is that we cut back (a lot). 

3. I think there are situations where it is okay to eat meat, such as subsistence hunting/farming. 


My responses to popular arguments I often hear for eating meat:

_

Appeals to Nature


1. Humans are omnivores; we evolved to eat meat. We need meat to live. 


Response: Being an omnivore doesn't mean one has to eat meat. We are capable of surviving on a large variety of diets, some of which contain meat, others do not. The important thing is being able to meet our nutrient and vitamin requirements. In the developed world we have access to such a wide variety of foods that it is completely reasonable to be a survive on a vegetarian diet with minimal effort (and scientists agree). A vegan diet is also possible, though this diet requires more foresight and planning.


2. We are at the top of the food chain, therefore we should eat meat.


Response: I also have a driver's licence but that doesn't mean I have to drive. I would also argue that those of us living in the developed world are not really part of the food chain as not only does our existence not hinge on the whims of the natural world in our immediate vicinity in any way, through technology we are completely removed from whatever ecosystems we live in to the extent where we can be just fine without having to know the first thing about survival in the wild. The majority of humans in the developed world have never hunted or fished nor do they even know how to exist in the natural world without leveraging technologies to soften the impact of doing so. We also have zero predators or prey in any of our human controlled environments unless we willingly remove ourselves from these environments to go and looking for them.


Also we have an opposable thumb, the capacity for abstract thought, and therefore the ability to shape the world around us. That gives us an unfair advantage over every other species on the planet. 


3. The Circle of Life (animals are jerks and kill each other all the time--why shouldn't we join in?) 


Response: Because we're too good at it. Other sentient beings don't have the power to raise entire species in captivity and harvest them over and over again once the meat is just right for selling/eating ad infinitum. I think the fact that we're capable of making tools at a scale where we can basically sculpt our environments to our liking and removes ourselves from nature to the point where we can lead abstract existences that are incomphrensible to any species living on this planet comes with some responsibilities, like that we should avoid dispensing suffering upon any form of sentient life when possible and we shouldn't shit where we eat, ie: wreck the planet to the point where we can't live here anymore.

4. Vegetarians/vegans indirectly kill animals anyway, it's unavoidable

Response: Yes, that stupid Maddox argument has been sent to me a dozen times between 1998 and now. It is true that vegans/vegetarians are indirectly responsible for the deaths of animals, particularly vegetarians as we still eat some animal products. Does that make the diet not worth doing? Hell no! My meat consumption is extremely low as the only meat I eat is accidental. I don't believe it's possible to completely avoid the suffering of animals, but I do seek to minimize it as much as is possible. 

People get too hung up on the titles ""vegan"" and ""vegetarian"". It's better to see them more as goals we should strive for or standards we should hold ourselves to, not a binary state like ""believer"" or ""nonbeliever"" that we need to cling to. 


Arguments for reducing meat consumption

_


Environmental 


Livestock cultivation is a huge contributor to greenhouse gases which is increasing as economies like China and India develop and the demand for meat in those countries increases. I believe livestock cultivation accounts for between 12-15% of greenhouse gases (of a total of %18 for agriculture), which is more than transportation. Also, cow farts (seriously) and animals that rechew regurgitated food are responsible for releasing two billion tonnes of methane (a greenhouse gas) into the atmosphere each year, which is being accelerated by rainforest deforestation to make way for more grazing land.


Ethical


I actually don't have a problem with subsistence hunting. I'd much rather people hunted their meat than went to the supermarket, though I recognize how impractical this would be at scale with 6 billion humans on the planet. 


Factory farming causes a huge amount of animal suffering, there is really no silver lining or any way to sugar coat it. Some operations are better than others and there are some farmers that treat their animals well (as has been shown on reddit frequently), however these tend to be the exception to the lowest bidder norm, especially outside of North America where vegetarian/vegan initiatives or ""free range"" or ""organic"" movements haven't taken root yet. Here in Korea and other parts of Asia, there aren't even any animal rights laws (absolutely zero--someone could murder a stray animal and nothing would come of it).


All one needs to do is spend a few hours on YouTube looking at footage obtained from factory farming operations to appreciate the true impact that it is having. That's without getting into the inherent dangers of factory farms as breeding grounds for super viruses with the potential to kill a lot of people through meat consumption. 


Alternatives Exist 


I agree that a lot of vegan soy-based meat products suck. I always chuckle at the Ron Swanson bit on Parks &amp; Rec where he says ""please my I have another?"" to the clerk offering free vegan bacon samples then proceeds to dump them in the garbage immediately afterwards.


The thing is that the alternatives are becoming better and more affordable. Companies like Beyond Meat (funded by Bill Gates) are actually trying to recreate authentic tasting meat through a new process that has results that are apparently indistinguishable from the real thing (especially chicken). In the long term, ""in vitro"" meat will reach a state where it does an excellent job of recreating the taste/texture of meat (eventually including fat), is scalable and ideally cheaper. The most important factors here are cost and taste: consumers will gladly eat fake chicken instead of real chicken if the fake chicken costs less and tastes better.


Conclusion

_


TL;DR To conclude, I still don't understand why this is such a controversial opinion, particularly on reddit and among my millenial peers. I'm not arguing that we should all become full on vegetarians/vegans here; I'm arguing that the entire world needs to cut back on meat consumption drastically for the above reasons. I'd really like to hear a convincing argument for eating meat at the current rates we do because I honestly can't imagine what a convincing argument would be yet the majority of people still refuse to accept the reality of meat consumption. ",{'he'}
"Throwaway account, my main is used for school.  

I'm 28, male, and a grad student (chemistry). I've been dating a girl for two years and our relationship is wonderful. She frequently brings up marriage and talks about how she believes I'll never propose to her, and I've told her that I'm honestly not sure how I feel about the whole concept of marriage. I would have no problem staying with her for my entire life, but I just don't understand how a ring and a piece of paper makes any difference.

Let me outline my preconceptions here: My parents' marriage fell apart due to infidelity and divorce. I watched my mom cheat on my dad, take all his money in court, and leave him psychologically damaged until the day he died. Admittedly it has me a bit scared.

Here are the benefits I often hear claimed about marriage, along with my response to them:

 More sex: We've been like bunnies for the whole relationship (at least twice a day) and honestly I have a pretty low sex drive. It's already more than enough.

 Children: I don't want kids, don't have kids, and am 100% sterile by choice. Nothing to do about it. She is equally happy to go without them.

 Added financial benefit / tax breaks: We already contribute equally to the relationship in terms of finances. We end up paying for everything about 50/50. Tax breaks? Ok, sure, but that's not going to sell me on it right off the bat.


Now here are some drawbacks I often see cited about marriage, along with my response:


 Expense: A ring is supposed to cost three month's salary?! A wedding costs over $10,000?! I'm a grad student, for crying out loud. This kind of stuff is absolutely not affordable, and even if it was it seems like a huge waste just to conform to a social norm. Paying more for a little bit of metal and rock than for a decent used car seems absolutely insane to me.


 Divorce Risk: Statistics don't lie. I have a 50/50 chance of going through exactly what my late father did.


I hate seeing how sad the thought of just being my girlfriend forever (but not my wife) makes her.  I love this girl a lot, but I am also a very rational and logical person and can't seem to find the personal justification for marriage.

Please, try to change my view - and thank you.

Edit 1:  Whoever you are, thank you for mass-downvoting all my responses.  I'm trying to have a civil discourse, and if I'm frustrating you I don't mean anything negative by it.

Edit 2:  Thank you all for your insight.  I have awarded one delta on this topic but for the most part I have not been convinced that marriage is for me.  Consider this CMV closed, although I may check back later to respond to any trailing opinions.

I appreciate your time, and thank you very much.

"I've recently subscribed to r/anime, and as a long time anime watcher and considering myself to have the appropriate amount of good taste, I feel that Sword Art Online is massively misrepresented as mediocre among fellow fans and otakus. Currently ranked #459 on MAL, this show scores an average rating of only 8 out of 10 nerd points.

I believe this is due primarily to hater votes. It should be in the top 50, if not top 25, anime of all time.

In fairness to the haters, the ALO arcs sort of ruined it with the whole sister romance harem thing. Japanese people are weird, but they sure know how to milk a hit show. For that reason, SAO II is not considered here; just vanilla SAO please!

Some Background

---

I am a 30-year old male product writer for the web, and I am not what most would consider an otaku or weeabo. (I prefer Korean culture, if we're comparing asking, and I don't go to cons, collect or read much Manga, or follow every anime series.) I watch anime recreationally, and consider myself a reasonable self-styled critic. I've recently watched quite a number of shows, being bored at home, and I've watched and rewatched SAO several times and am familiar with it.


---

Why The Show Is Good

Characters: The cast is great. Voice acting isn't overdone or underdone, and the characters all feel like people from a real world stuck in a game for a long time together. It also makes sense that they're all there.

Plot: The premise is not made of solid gold, but it's interesting enough to lend itself to greatness. If you die in the game, you die for real no quitsies. This has been done before in fiction, of course. However, SAO takes a different treatment of this premise. Normally, you would see horror, like in a show like Gantz, applied, or game aspects, such as in No Game No Life. 

SAO's goal is rather to show that a virtual world can be real and fulfilling. Its creators accomplish this by focusing not on the MMO aspects, which are limited to flavor, but rather on the interaction between strong characters and the tension of being trapped within this scary world. The story itself lends itself to a rich world, and the writers take advantage of the larger arc to fit in almost a dozen sub-arcs in 24 episodes. The show is very story dense for an anime; normally, a single sub-arc would take 4-6 episodes. These sub-arcs balance developing the world, fighting, and building relationships. The characters build on their strengths and flaws and often find themselves in situations partially crafted of their own making. (Example; Asuna is hard on her guild and pushy, and this results in a poor culture within the guild that causes problems as the series develops.) There are no unbelievable moments.

In the end, the heroes triumph, but it's not a boring triumph. They often sacrifice during the show and make many mistakes that weigh upon them. At the ending bar scene, you can feel the air of both relief and regret washing over all of the former players.

At the symbolic level, SAO is very symbolic of life itself. God puts us on this plant, and we don't get to leave unless we die. So we adapt to it and live in it, the same as in SAO's virtual world. This allegoric story pairs well with the show's many slice-of-life scenes, creating a very vibrant and real-seeming virtual world.

Writing: SAO does not waste time or words. No episode is filler, and each main character is multi-dimensional and arrives naturally in the main story arc. Characters do not break character. Villains are villains. Episodes are succinct and excellently paced. This show is so clean that you can eat off of it.

Art: The art direction is superb. Each character's outfit is suitable for their personality and status. Motion and combat is more fluid and direct as well as it was in Fate: UBW and other highly regarded similar shows. It was smoother than classic epics like Record of Lodoss War and Gurren Lagann or modern releases like Arslan. Admittedly, it probably had a bigger budget than those shows, but that shouldn't be a detracting factor at all. The only fantasy world anime I would give a higher regard to in art direction is Berserk, but in quality of animation, SAO crushes Berserk.

The only complaint you could make in the art department is that the show wasn't stylized enough to differentiate it from other fantasy anime.  For instance, the art direction in Kill la Kill was an incredible thematic rush of color with awesome hand-painted backgrounds. I'll grant that point, but can you name a fantasy anime with a better quality of animation offhand?

Avoids Most Awful Anime Pitfalls: Fanservice, chibi conversations, people falling off of park benches or turning into paper; these are the marks of an anime breaking the fourth wall and ruining suspension of disbelief for the view. In short, they're signs that an anime doesn't take itself seriously. Almost no anime of any level of notoriety, excluding comedies, uses these generic tactics.

Arguments Against

 Overpowered Main Character

The story follows Kirito, a regular guy with some Kendo training and beta test experience in an online game. Kirito earns almost all of his levels solo and is on par with the very best fighters in the game. He starts off with an advantage due to his experience, gets full exp. for the very first boss, and grinds pretty much every day from there on out to stay on top of the curve. He clearly earns his main character slot through a number of trials instead of being handed it by the divine will of the writers, such as in every other anime ever. He is given a unique skill, eventually, which is powerful, but it's relatively balanced because it's difficult to use. His backstory and skillset are reasonable, and given that there must be a ""best"" among all the players, it makes sense that the show would follow him.

Meanwhile, in How to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon, the main character is literally given a skill that says ""become overpowered against things you can't beat."" It's shit like that which makes me want to throw my laptop.

 Dumb Plot Moments

In the first or second episode, another beta tester dies in Kirito's arms not because he was defeated, but because he turned down a potion. That guy was obviously a fuckin' idiot, and that scene could have been saved if he had just drank up and laid there. This is a fair criticism. Additionally, the army guild unit that marches in to fight the minotaur boss half dead is also made of retards. However, it's noted in the show that the reason they do this is because the army has been terrorizing its members. However, those deaths serve a purpose within the show and are not overtly distracting. The dumb beta guy's death serves to inspire Kirito to action and turns him into the MC. The dumb army guys are, much like the group that runs into the trap room early in the series, there to set Kirito on the right path and force him into action.

In the meantime, how will you excuse characters like Faye Valentine in one of your favorite anime, Cowboy Bebop? She's just there to be a plot instigator with a pair of giant boobs. Almost. Entirely. Fanservice. Many other very good anime have done much much worse with their cast and still rank top 50. Hell, Hajime no Ippo is fan ranked 20 on MAL, and although I won't disagree that the show is awesome, it's just following the formula of a hundred other sports anime shows like Prince of Tennis. OWARI NO SERAPH is even up there, and that show literally only has one redeeming character -- who isn't in most episodes. Hell, characters are invented out of thin air and people do dumb shit in Game of Thrones every other episode. Are you really going to say that SAO's weak point is a few serviceable plot blunders and side characters that didn't think through some obvious mistakes?

 You didn't like the ending

The ending probably irked a few of people because it was so sudden. However, that's really the magic of the series. It's a virtual world controlled by a nutty, manipulative scientist-god whose purposes are unknown. That's the driving mystery behind every episode. Why are they even there? Why is the NPC planted in the guild as the final boss? Why is the psychologist AI disabled?

Without that underlying tension, the series doesn't take shape. The story is about human actors making intense decisions, and the elusive creator adds another layer to the conflict. It makes the story feel bigger than it is and every victory seem hollow. This in turn allows our main characters to keep driving forward.

Plus, they've already put in so many boss fights. I thought the defeat of the technically invincible guild leader was an awesome way to end, although it's obviously hedging a sequel.

I'm tired of typing, so I won't bore you with more examples. Although I really wish they had done much more with the sequels, I believe the original series ranks among the best-produced, best scripted, cleanest, most heartfelt Anime of all time. I look forward to your spirited replies.

"Reddit execs have been taking a bit image hit over the last few days. The issues are numerous but it seems like the catalyst for the blackout was the way they let go of Victoria without involving the reddit community or communicating with them, and seemingly having no plan of action on how to fill the gap in her responsibilities. 

I believe that perfectly acceptable reasons could have caused this course of action and to not accept that possibility and start a blackout and/or reddit exodus is irrational. 

For example - a few years ago my company fired a VP quickly without having a real good plan on how to bridge the gap before we found a replacement. This individual had referred to another manager(semi-openly gay) as ""the faggot"" in a small meeting. We simply could not tolerate that behavior so we fired him the next day. It wasn't what was best for our bottom line, but it was best for the environment and culture that our company believes in. We didn't feel it was in the best interest of telling the whole company the reasoning for termination and several on that team were very upset by the clearly abrupt and unplanned separation - for several people their impression was ""management doesn't have their shit together"". 

I could imagine several scenarios where Victoria should be terminated quickly and it would not be appropriate to give a reason publicly. I would even say that reddit has been incredibly professional by continuing to remain silent on her termination even when facing the vastly damaging public backlash. ",{'him'}
"First of all, I want to first express how happy I am with this subreddit. It has always been a hub for civilized discussion on complicated and difficult topics. I have never witnessed uncivilized discussion on here before and I'm glad to be a part of the community. Good job, Reddit!

With that said, if you are unfamiliar with the sexual revolution I am referring to, this is a time beginning in the 1960s where people experienced an ""urge to 'find oneself'"" (Wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_revolution)). During this time, lots of previously taboo'd sexually related acts, ideals, etc entered into society and have more recently, at the end of the 20th century have thoroughly integrated themselves into it. This involves a large variety of things including but not limited to: proliferation and normalization of pornography, sex before marriage, acceptance of sexually explicit movie/television material, contraceptions, and the LGBT movement.

For example, pornography, which was formerly unheard of in public conversation is now often not only discussed, but glorified and upheld as a great thing. This is just one example of what I am talking about. I am not arguing the moralities of pornography however.

My argument: The recent decision by the Supreme Court to rule in favor of gay marriage is simply the next step in the sexual revolution and essentially negates some of the arguments against the next step after this; I am specifically referring to  incestuous relationships, and other ways of ""loving"" someone. However, I will mainly refer to incest for the sake of a shorter discussion.

 One of the main arguments against gay marriage is that it is ""unnatural"". One could also argue that incest is unnatural, but even more broadly, any sexual relationship outside of marriage between a man and woman can be argued effectively as unnatural.

 Gay marriage activists very frequently champion progressive thinking and non-discrimination as basis for legalizing gay marriage. The term progressive is very open for interpretation, but eliminating discrimination is very straight forward. If someone named Cercei loves her brother named Jamie, should it be allowed? Should they be allowed to marry and procreate? Incestuous relationships very often breed deformities and retardations in children; should these children be forced to have an incomplete, handicapped life on the basis of equality. For more information on incest please view this very informative documentary.

 Another argument against gay marriage has frequently been that it further inhibits the ability for the human race to procreate. This is fairly obvious as to why people say this: a man and a man cannot bear a child and vice versa. However, the same argument stands for incest; in fact, it is worse. Incestuous relationships don't further the human species, but rather they turn it backwards by corrupting genes and eliminating diversity. Also, as previously stated, incest often results in retardation in the resulting child.

With gay marriage legalized officially, these arguments become unsubstantial and hypocritical to argue with against incest.

In conclusion, my fear is that the sexual revolution has the potential to continue to progress and eventually today's taboos will become everyday occurrences all on the basis of equality and non-discrimination. This has the potential to effect humans on not only a genetic level by potentially allowing incest to corrupt human genetic material and cause genetic disorders, but also on a societal level where humans become more concerned with catering to someones sexual identity/preference rather than the actual person inside. I believe this could be devastating to humans. I don't claim to know what would happen, but it isn't too difficult to come up with a worst-case scenario of what society could become when the main focus of peoples interactions is politically correctness, being non-offensive, and catering to every form of person on a sexual basis.

Please feel free to ask questions and I will be happy to clarify.

CMV,
Tresky

Disclaimer: I am in no way attempting to say that gay marriage in and of itself is causing the downfall of humanity and am not attempting to demonize or put-down members of the LGBT community. I am merely making a case of a path that humanity could potentially be (and I now believe is) on that leads to a corrupt and evil society.

"Back in the day, the only thing Princess Peach did was get kidnapped by King Bowser. For the purposes of the story and the limited resources available to the developers, saving the princess was the main goal. It made sense. But as time went on we get to see Nintendo princesses and women kick serious ass. Samus, Zelda (and Sheik!) and even Princess Peach when she's not getting kidnapped.

We see women characters in Nintendo games get treated as equals in games like Mario Kart, Mario Party/sports games and even Smash Bros. Princess Peach is one of the best characters in Sm4sh if you ask me. And while Nintendo has some progress to make (Super Princess Peach was an embarrassment), games like Super Mario 3D world (where Peach AND Rosalina are playable) show that they're willing to make the women the star of the show too.

Even in the Zelda series, Princess Zelda isn't a character that just gets kidnapped. Twilight Princess shows us that she's the strong and powerful ruler of Hyrule. She was willing to stand up to Zant and Gannon, with a sword in her hand. Even in Ocarina of Time (spoilers ahead, lol) she is running around helping out Link as Sheik. In Wind Waker she's a kick-ass, take no prisoners kind of pirate.

I know that the history of ""your princess is in another castle"" type stories are problematic but we've seen Nintendo's female characters grow and mature in a way that few other female video game characters have.",{'king'}

"I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit or not, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a ""slut"" the poster gets railed for it. I also don't think it is strictly the language being used. Regardless of the label, not wanting your partner to have been with 5+ people is 100% defensible. If we, as a society, can tell people that being tall is attractive or that being fat is unattractive, we can tell being that sleeping around is unattractive.     

Another logically invalid argument is that the person with the preference, must not be promiscuous themselves. I think this is as non-nonsensical as telling a man he can only be attracted to men, otherwise he's hypocritical. My choice in partner is independent of my partner's choice in me, we can like different things. Many physically fit men are ""chubby-chasers"" and man slutty men are virginal chasers. 


Edit: To clarify, the use of the words ""slut"" earlier was merely a reflection of the term as it has been used on Reddit. I do not view a persons' worth as tied to their sexual history. I also don't have an moral qualms towards premarital sex or number of sexual partners. That said, my personal level of attraction is affected.

"I spend my summer as a representative of the college I attend and interact regularly with kids between the ages of 10 and 18. In these interactions, I have noticed that - regardless of age and gender, these kids are often unable to write in cursive and sometimes even their print Handwriting is hardly legible.
Now, I realize that we live in the digital age and typing is king (I think touch typing should also be taught), but I believe that learning handwriting from an early age (and throughout even high school) has several benefits including...
1) Improved sense of symmetry and order
2) Improved appreciation for art of different time periods
3) Larger/more diverse vocabulary
4) Prepares users for the business world where signatures and other handwritten items are still fairly common

"For whatever reason men commit about 80-90% of crimes in every society that they exist in. The numbers get a little more equitable when we account for property crimes where men only outnumber women 2:1. However, white collar crimes, blue collar crimes, violent crimes, sexual crimes, etc. are so vastly male-centric that the numbers increase that much. They are both the overwhelming amount of perpetrators and victimized, though women are victimized significantly, as you'd expect, in intimate crimes and sex-related offenses. 

Aside from criminality, men are also more likely to be impulsive and aggressive which is likely to eliminate cohesion and cause undue caution due to the erratic, unpredictably violent and harmful action of this sub-group. 

Why does this persist? Why are men so much more criminal and violent? Does this have a tangibly negative effect on society?

"First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person and I can admit when I am wrong.

I do not buy into the whole argument of 'just because our parents brought us into the world, we owe them our lives.' Whether a child was brought into the world by choice or not, I don't think that being born should impose a debt of respect on the child. 

Furthermore, I think that this respect needs to be earned. I define respect in this context as 'regard for another person's rational ability, trusting that they can admit when they are wrong and that their decisions are well-thought-out.'

This is why I think that giving the reason 'because I said so' is a total cop out. If the parent is not open to having a conversation about the reason for their actions, then I don't think they deserve the child's respect. 

Don't get me wrong, I think it is crucial for a child to be told when they are wrong so that they don't grow up into narcissistic asshats. However, I think that they deserve a logical conversation with a parent until one side admits, of his own accord, that he is in the wrong.

Studying Sikhism, the rampant censorship, hate and murder from Emperor Jahangir and Aurangzeb of the muslim Mughal Empire against the Sikh people, the church's resistance to adopt condoms, and therefore aiding the spread of AIDS, especially in Africa. Bear in mind I've been brought up in a secular area of Britain and that may distort my view in the same way people who are brought up in ultra religious societies. I probably sound awfully pretentious and I apologise for that.  Please either refine or change my view.

"I believe that it is bad for humans generally that we have patriotism. It leads not only to discrimination. (hello Mr Trump)
But also to economic and political difficulties and misstrust.

It prevents not only people from accepting everyone as their partner in human, but also causes hatred and sometimes war between nations or ethnic groups.

I dont mean that partriotism is worse than no patriotism, but that as a concept and as an element we experience all the time it it in itself bad for us.

(Intrinsic badness versus comparative badness) 

Without patriotism we could form one great community and society. This is prevented by prejudice against others and arrogance about themselves, partiotism conveys.

"I view taxation as theft because if you refuse to pay, men with guns  namely, cops will kidnap you and lock you away. I oppose obamacare, social security, medicare, and medicaid as immoral because theyre coercive. I belive you own your body and, therefore, can put whatever you want in it. If you own your body, you own your labor. So you have the right to rent your labor to any employer at any price. Therefore, we should abolish the minimum wage.

"America has accomplished nothing in its history that makes it worth of such widespread pride and love by its people (particularly this time of the year). Every event that Americans glorify either has a disgusting background to it or is grossly misread by most people. These are some examples:

-The American Revolution: It did involve great thinkers and advancement of political philosophy, but the French did it better, and American Revolution was an overreaction to British enforcement of fair taxes that paid for the 7 Years War to protect Americans. 
-Industrial revolution: Granted high developments in technology and economic prowess were built on slavery, child labor, discrimination against immigrants, poverty and greedy, amoral robber barons and corrupt politicians. 
Civil War: The fact that it needed to happen and that a flag that represents those who fought to defend slavery is still being flown and celebrated is disappointing. 
World War 2: Significant military power, certainly helped turn the tide, still killed 300,000 civilians with atomic weapons and put Asian Americans in camps (with little reparation that came way too late).

Of course there are worse countries in the world, but current day America is a wreck. Frequent mass shootings that don't really happen in other developed countries, continued high race tensions, religious fundamentalism in the South and a poor education system. So tell me CMV, is there any reason to celebrate or be proud of my country?

"Bernie Sanders is clearly an intelligent man with a lot of interesting views, many of which I support. I think him getting some traction in the election is a great way to draw attention to those ideas.  But right now I feel I cannot truly support him for actually being elected president because of his age.

Bernie Sanders will be 75 when the next president of the USA is elected.  If elected, he would be 79 at the end of his first term, and if re-elected would be 83 at the end of his second term. The oldest president in US history was Ronald Reagan, elected at 69 years old.  And he ran into health trouble later in his presidency.

The man appears to be in good health now, but health can decline quite precipitously at that age.  A president dying is a trying thing for the country, but I think a president in ever-declining health would be worse. 

In addition, POTUS is an incredibly demanding job.  I am quite skeptical that someone that age can really keep up with the rigors of such a job, even if they manage to stay in otherwise good health. 

I currently feel these concerns are strong enough that they outweigh any support I have for his views. Care to change my mind?

"I acknowledge straight away that sending checks to black people will not solve all modern the issues caused by the slave economy. 

With that said, I do believe that the government owes the reparation. The fact of the matter is that slaves generated wealth for their owners. This wealth translates into capital that is still present in our economy. 

A good amount of this capital went to the federal government. The government taxed some of the capital generated by slaves for owners. 

Some other capital was produced directly for the government. Slaves built the Capitol building. Slaves built the Treasury, and their capital rests in the Treasury.

So we can think of reparations as back pay. The recipients are not here to accept it, so their most direct heirs are entitled to it.

"In fact, they are not leashes - they are harnesses. 

Disneyland a couple years ago, my brothers, sister, cousin, dad and stepmom are walking past the dumbo ride, towards the Matterhorn. 
My cousin is about 12. It's very, very crowded. You see a lot of people with young kids on ""leashes""  - harnesses. My dad makes a comment about people walking around with young children on harnesses, calling them leashes.  




Meanwhile, my cousin kind of disappears, wanders off. We found her 30 seconds later - not a big deal. She's 12 and she's so spacy she wanders off. 
I'm not saying a 12 year old should be wearing a harness - that'd be humiliating at her age, but when she was younger she used to do that too. Just vanish into a crowd in a matter of seconds. 



Anyway, child harnesses are extremely different from dog leashes:

 They do not go around the child's neck. 
 Parents do not hold leashes in their hand
 A harness is a strap tied around the parents' waist and a strap tied around the child's torso. 
 You keep a dog on a leash to control it's behavior. 
 You keep a child on a harness because Disneyland is extremely crowded and I could very easily see how you can turn around for 2 seconds and your 5 year old has wandered off, vanished, or been picked up by a child snatcher. 

TL;DR: Children on ""leashes"" which are actually harnesses is in no way tantamount to treating your children like animals.

"1: The Roman Catholic church is institutionally guilty of evasion of justice for shielding rapists from trial all around the world. This behavior permits the further rape of children by not properly stopping it. The corruption goes all the way up to the top levels, including former pope Benedict, while he lived as Joseph Ratzinger, overseeing the movement of the fugitives.

2: Catholics who believe the theology of the church have alternative options. They could join the Anglican or Episcopal churches, which have, for all intents and purposes, identical doctrine, or make a brand new Catholic Church 2.0, identical to the old church except for the criminal bureaucracy.


3: Practicing Catholics donate 10% of their income to the church. Thus, they support the criminal organization monetarily.

That ""Alex from Target"" kid got popular in about a day for no reason whatsoever. Now think about someone who could potentially lead a nation - someone who many people are very passionate about supporting. Sanders will become just as much a household name as other prominent candidate.

"tl;dr - Nature dictates  that the strong survive and the weak perish. Those with power will do and those without power will not. Human beings are naturally selfish and self serving creatures even through our acts of love and kindness. Due to these 2 facts, there is nothing in this world that compels us to live for another human being other than the threats of punishments and promises of rewards religion brings.

I've broken my argument down into 4 parts and a final part to make it more digestible.

Part I: The Law of the Land

Right and wrong are man made concepts that apply only to humans. No other creature on earth follows rules of morality and ethics other than human beings. Nature dictates that the strong will survive and the weak will perish. Who tells a lion it is wrong to slaughter a gazelle for food when it can just as easily find plant life to eat? Imagine if cows and chickens could talk. Imagine one of them walking up to you and saying ""Human, I have feelings and emotions. You capture and breed my kind as livestock and reduced our existence to the mere purpose of providing you food. We have hopes and dreams and aspirations. We do not want to die"". You, like myself and like the lion would reply ""HAHAHA I eat you because I have the power to and you do not have the power to stop me. I have been equipped to exert my dominance over you and will do so because such is the law of the land"" and you would have every right to say so. If you have the power to do so, whatever it is, then it is in your right. Morals and ethics are immaterial, there are only absolutes (strength, speed, intelligence). This is the world we live in. 

Part II &amp; III: The Nature of the Human Psyche &amp; The Mysteries of Love

I am not religious nor do I believe in a god but I am a visionary. I often thought of how to create a ""perfect"" society free of corruption and greed. No matter how much I contemplated on how such a society could be formed, I always arrived to the same conclusion: perfect societies are impossible because of human self interest. The most basic instinct in every living creature is survival. Every living creature on earth seeks to increase its own utility (content, happiness) through primary needs such as food, water and shelter but also through secondary needs such as entertainment, love, and companionship. Our entire existence is a goal to acquire those needs and serve our self interests. Greed will always exist because it is in our best self interest to be greedy. Corruption, cheating, stealing, lying - we do all of these things because they serve us. They work to achieve our desires and fulfill our self interests. 


Right now you're probably saying something like ""well then how do you explain the love we have for other people"". Understanding ""love"" is a mystery unto itself that I can't fully explain but I can say that for the most part, it still functions (for the most part) under self interest. The love we show our close family and friends is a result of having familiarity (and I would even go far as to say a sense of belonging/ownership) to them. MY son, MY daughter, MY mom, MY dad, MY friend, my my my....We typically don't develop love for other people until they have a stake in OUR lives. Whether you find them funny or charming or simply and inherent love that comes with coming from the same bloodline, we appreciate them for the joy they bring into our lives. Next you might say what about the compassion and kindness we show strangers less fortunate then ourselves such as the homeless people downtown or starving children in Africa. To that I ask you can anyone truly appreciate the pain of others without ever experiencing it or having the ability to sympathize with it first themselves (empathy)? Without familiarity to one's suffering on at least a basic level, I believe it is impossible to truly care for that person's well being. Think about it, when you give a homeless man $10 to buy lunch that day, you're doing it because you understand the pain of going hungry. Had you never experienced hunger or at least been able to empathize with his feeling of hunger, you almost certainly would not care for that individual's problems because you simply cannot relate to them. It is not until you can put yourself (literally, psychologically, or emotionally) into someone's situation that you feel compelled to make a change in that persons life. So I will repeat myself when I say everything we do is dictated by self interest, even the love and kindness we show others. I cannot think of one thing human beings are known to do that does not give us some kind of emotional, psychological or literal satisfaction.

Whether they are from a different race, sex, religion, or culture, we fail to empathize with those who we view as different than ourselves and cannot place ourselves in their situation. Most genocides are typically predated by a period of propaganda used to besmirch the victimized group and dehumanize them from the people who commit the act. The German people didn't let the Nazi power commit their terrible acts because Germans are inherently evil, they did so because they were brainwashed not to identify with Jews as fellow human beings but as trash that needed to be exterminated. Everything we do is dictated by the self interest we hold in ourselves. 

Part IV: An Inconvenient truth

And this brings us to the crux of my argument. When you live in a world where the only thing stopping you from doing as you please are your own capabilities and your main drive for living is serving your own self interests, what use is there to care for other living creatures? What compels us to help those less fortunate than ourselves other than the satisfaction we get from knowing we did something ""good""? What is there in the world to compel us to live for someone other than oneself? You guessed it: religion. The only thing that objectively compels us to live for other human beings are the punishment and rewards religion brings. The only thing that truly compels humanity to care for others is knowing that if you don't, an infinitely more powerful being than yourself will punish you for it. There is no subjectivity here: either you do it and get rewarded or don't and pay. Even if you hate the person you are helping and cannot empathize with them whatsoever, you do it because it is in your own self interest. I have literally met people who have said they help others not because they want to necessarily but God wants them to. I will use Judaeo-Christianity as an example because it is the religion I am most familiar with. As awful as some of the messages in the Bible are, there are some good virtues in them as well such as helping those less fortunate and embracing your fellow man with love and kindness. The problem with this is most of us don't care about helping people we don't know and very very few of us would go out of our way to do so simply out of personal satisfaction. Without the threat and rewards religions bring, there is nothing compelling us to live for our fellow man.


Part Finale: Common Counter Arguments:

But you even said yourself religion is motivated through self interest. Aren't there also scenarios where showing other human beings kindness serve our self interests and compel us to live for our fellow man?

No. Showing kindess does not compel us to live for our fellow man because there is always the use of force. Remember the law of the land: Those with power will do and those without power will not. I cannot think of a single scenario where the use of kindness cannot be substituted for the use of force.

Religion does not compel us to do anything because you don't have to believe in a god

I'm not saying everyone has to believe in a god or that identifying with a religion automatically compels you to live for other people. I'm saying those who truly do believe in the existence of a heaven and hell and truly do hold the values of their religion are compelled and those who do not believe have nothing in this world to compel them to. 

My rant is officially over. Now someone change my view.

"So I'm not sure how many of you guys are aware of the recent events in the MtG world but today a professional player, Zach Jesse, was banned presumably because of his past criminal history which includes a sexual assault guilty plea when he was 19. I'm not aware of the exact circumstances surrounding his offense. 

What unsettles me about the ban is that it seems to have occurred because another player, Drew Levin, pointed out Jesse's criminal past with a Twitter post: """"Quick reminder: Zach Jesse is a literal rapist who got away with serving three months of an eight year plea deal."" It should be noted that this is a very speculative and misleading statement, as the public is not aware of the details surrounding his plea.

Wizards of the Coast gave a short statement saying that the reasoning behind the ban was to ensure that players feel safe at events. Obviously a worthy endeavor, but I don't see how it really applies here. We are talking about large events at convention centers with thousands of people, security, etc. If, in the eyes of the law, he is not considered a threat to the public (i.e. not in jail) then how can Wizards see him as one?

And what's the point in attempting to rehabilitate criminals if they are to be forever shunned from participating even in large public events? It's not like the guy is applying for a teaching job at an elementary school or something. They even banned him from online play.

Lastly, I do not think Wizards should have taken this action based on a Twitter witch-hunt that was started by another player. If they want to have a universal no criminal record policy at all of their events, then maybe it would be justified. But to selectively ban one person because he was villified on a social media site is pretty unreasonable, IMO.

I want to hear people's thoughts on this because it seems like the r/magictcg community is vehemently opposed to the ban. I'd like to hear some outside opinion's. The SRS crowd seems to support the ban, calling r/magictcg a bunch of rape apologists, etc, but then again the SRS crowd is not very logical or reasonable. So I'd like to hear what you all think. CMV,

Edit: If anyone can provide a source that he was convicted of rape, I will award you a delta.

Edit: So my view has been changed due to new information I have been made aware of regarding the details of Jesse's crime. Anally raping an unconscious girl over a toilet is pretty despicable, I had no idea his offense was even close to that magnitude. Thanks everyone who responded here. I can understand with why Wizards does not want someone who has done something so vulgar to be a top name in their tournament scene.

"I'll try to keep my thoughts as simple as possible. 

Where I live there are only two bars with in walking distance. One of the bars is by all accounts unpleasant. They have sketchy clientele, high prices, bad food, and terrible service. My girlfriend feels uncomfortable there because of the behavior of the patrons and the employees who do nothing to stop it. 

The other bar is a gay bar. It's cleaner, has better service, better drink deals and is much more women friendly (which my girlfriend appreciates). Now I had regularly gone to this bar in the past by myself, usually to just grab a drink after work, watch a wizards game (I don't have cable so I go to bars for my sports) then leave. This past tuesday I brought my girlfriend there for the first time. After about an hour the waiter asked us to leave. He told us it was 'gay safe' and a 'gay space', that they didn't want us taking over there space and that we were making some patrons uncomfortable.  So we paid and left, trying to not make a scene or cause any problems.

Now I've had a couple days to think about this and as right now would be a time that I would have stopped in for a beer, I'm a little pissed.

I feel like I've been discriminated against because of my sexuality which is something that the Gay community has fought to stop. I've always been supportive of the LGBT community, and I don't want to make a straw-man argument, but I can't not see hypocrisy in this.

"First let me say that I strongly disagree with the death penalty and would like very much to see it abolished; I just feel it should be done with an amendment, rather than by a supreme court ruling.

Justice Scalia states that it is the court's responsibility to decide whether or not laws violate the constitution. Glossip contested that lethal injection violated the 8th amendment (cruel and unusual punishment.)  Breye's dissent argued that the death penalty, in and of itself, is cruel and unusual punishment.

The authors of the constitution were well aware of the death penalty (which, at the time, was the only punishment for a felony), and had they meant for it to be outlawed, they would have specifically mentioned it.  

You might consider hanging or firing squads (the methods used at the time the constitution was written) to be  more humane than lethal injection, but this argument could be countered by simply giving the inmate a choice between the three.  

I feel that Scalia is just doing the job he was appointed to do. It is not the place of the supreme court to make or strike down laws based on what they feel is right or wrong.  It is their job to interpret whether or not laws violate the constitution.  It is our job as a population to elect representatives to change the law.

"Ok, I first posted this(https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1qc9pw/the_real_reason_why_child_porn_is_illegal/) last year. My mistake was going to /r/philosophy hoping that no topic is off limits for so called lovers of wisdom. To my surprise even they can get quite boorish when they suspect that the person who posted has a pedo agenda behind him. For the record, I don't have one. I don't like appearing as if I am being defensive but I feel I have to say that because I have posted this opinion in the past and in my experience it is too provocative for most people to remain civil and rely only on the rational parts of their brains. BTW I have spoken about this with real life friends and professors - none of them have had any second thoughts about whether I am mentally ill or a child abuser or have been provoked to anger in any way - quite a contrast to the online forums. Anyway I am genuinely subordinate to the truth of the issue and my promise is that if I find any convincing arguments to the contrary I will change my mind. Hopefully this subreddit is full of people who are interested in discussion and not name-calling, witch-hunting, and all other sorts of abuse. If not, then I've lost all hope for the internet. 

First I'd like to make clear where I'm standing. I believe that amorous emotions that teenagers experience are very real and should be taken seriously. In other words, they are capable of genuine feelings of love and for the most part know what is in their best interest when they take part in a relationship. It's pretty clear also that we have almost no problem with them having sex with other teenagers their own age. Or if we do, then we aren't doing anything about it and have very relaxed attitude. Therefore, we believe that teenagers are capable of consenting to sexual activity to other teenagers. 

Now here is my main argument: If we do believe that teenagers can consent to have sex with each other, I believe that this means that they are able to give consent in general. It seems to me that it is inconsistent to believe that teenagers can consent to have sex with each other and not with adults because consent is something that is determined from within and is in no way dependent on the age of the other person. Therefore teenagers are actually capable of consenting to have sex with adults. 

This is not a strawman at all. From the first comment of that post I linked by user slickwombat:  

 they are taken to be not capable of giving adequately informed and rational consent. 


Another one from dogGirl666 found here(https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bmka6/why_is_it_ok_to_let_my_daughter_fuck_some_14yo/csoi92k?context=3):
 a teenager is unable to think like an adult

If what slickwombat and dogGirl666 are saying is true, why let them have sex at all? Wouldn't that be potentially letting them fall into abuse out of their own doing? To me it is highly suspect to have a situation where we are extremely lax, or even encouraging, toward two 15 year olds having sex but as soon as that 15 year old has sex with a 20 year old, it is called child abuse. I'm not sure how this attitude came to be - it is possible that it arose out the moral panic from the 70s where children were being ritually abused in a day care center - before that there weren't even laws on child pornography. It was not even considered weird or perverse a hundred years ago for very older men to be engaged to girls who were still going through or just past puberty. So just as the new atheists come and try to flip the table on theists to prove their claim on the existence of god, who are we to say that before the 20th century, all societies were pathological where child abuse was rampant? I'm not saying that it is actually a good thing if it were the norm, for example, that girls were married at age 13, just that why the swing of the pendulum is justified at all. So in other words, I'm laying the burden of proof on you to to prove that all or a sufficiently high number of cases of adult-adolescent sexual interaction results in the adolescent being harmed. Or barring that, why the thesis - that allowing teenagers to consent to other teenagers but not to adults is inconsistent - is wrong. 

I know what the first reaction will be and although I admit to not having a good rebuttal to it, my answer is equally forceful as yours will be. First, let's be aware that teenagers naturally don't want to have sex with someone disproportionately out of their age group. They find it creepy, just like any normal human being would, and our laws of consent prohibit any unwanted interaction or even advances. Second, I believe that teenagers are for the most part and perhaps with the help of a little awareness and education, able to determine what is in their best interest when it comes to seeking a relationship. That doesn't mean that they are perfectly able to avoid negative experiences from it. That's the name of the game. Next, I would like to know from you that just allowing adult-adolescent sexual relations to happen, that there WILL be abuse. How do you know that teenage boys aren't already abusing other teenage girls if they are so impressionable at their age as most people would like to believe? How can you even adjudicate this when you define adult-adolescent sex ITSELF as abuse? 

The last point I'd like to cover is supportive of my thesis. I mentioned this in my other post and I think it is a fairly strong point - and that is that our opinion toward young people is idealized and our attitude toward them is overly protective. Case in point: groping a female is abuse only if she's underage. My point is that we give in to our emotions more when it comes to children for some reason. I believe this may be connected to our attitudes on adults-adolescent relations. 

That pretty much concludes it. If you will answer, I would like to challenge you to make it clear on where you stand on the following questions: 

1) If you had an underage daughter, would you let her date an older man if you knew 100% that they would not have sex; 
2) On the topic of consent, would you agree that any girl who voluntarily takes a topless photo of herself and sends it over snapchat is abusing herself? 
3) continuing the above question, if no, then would you consider it abuse if she took that photo and handed it over to her boyfriend, who then would be guilty of possessing child pornography?
4) Do you think it is possible for older men to genuinely fall in love with teenage girls? 
5) An older man has sex with an 18-year old. Turns out she lied about her age and she's really 16. Was the girl sexually abused?

"Hip-hop has become mainstream music. Songs containing some variation of the N-Word routinely rank high on song charts. 

 Drakes 0 to 100 / The Catch Up got as high as 35th of the Billboard top 100 with the refrain of the song prominently featuring nigga with the second line containing the word ""Fuck bein' on some chill shit We go 0 to 100 nigga, real quick"" and the outro of the first half of the song containing nigga every other line.

 Kanye West's All of the Lights got to 18 on the billboard top 100, it was also nominated for three Grammys including Song of the Year and won two Grammys: Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung collaboration. It includes several uses of the word nigga and draws attention to it with emphasise in this portion of the song ""Something wrong. I hold my head. M.J. gone, our nigga dead!""

There are countless examples of incredibly popular songs containing variations of the N-Word, these are just two examples I pulled because everyone knows Drake or Kanye and how popular they are. 



I believe white people should be allowed to quote along with these songs in their entirety without censoring the portions that contain the N-Word. I've been to several parties that have many people of many different races in attendance and these types of songs are played quite often. It is always odd when an entire portion of the party ceases to quote along with the song as another portion does and I believe it just draws attention to the racial divide that this word creates.

I am not advocating for widespread usage of the N-word. My point isn't that white people should have free usage of the N-word but I do believe in the context of singing along to a song that it shouldn't be frowned upon and shouldn't be seen as offensive, especially considering how popular hip-hop has become. 

I'd equate it to anything else that is offensive, out of context quoting a recent episode of True Detective ""I'll come back and butt-fuck your father with your mom's headless corpse on this lawn.""

Out of context, telling someone you're going to butt-fuck their father with their mom's head would be incredibly offensive, but in a discussion about the show or while rewatching the show with others it is perfectly acceptable to say something that would otherwise be offensive.

"I firmly beleive that drag queens are one of the reasons why Transgender people are ostracised from society, and I (speaking as a transwoman) find it
hard to be accepted and understood by a large portion of the population. 

A drag act is just that. An act. It is not supposed to be taken seriously (just look at the bearded lady Conchita Wurst) and as far as I understand
a drag queen isn't supposed to 'pass' in the transgender sense. A drag queen may have a 'female persona' but they are not transgender, it's not a medical
condition.

I'm going to assume that most people in the west know what a transgender person is, and what a drag queen is and can probably tell the difference. But
I am also going to assume that most people don't know what it actually means to be transgender, that it isn't a choice. The only choice a transgender
individual makes is the choice to transition. 

I feel as if because of drag queens and the confusion between a transgender person and a drag act, we're not taken seriously by someone who can't tell the difference. I am not a drag queen, I don't put on an act, or dress ridiclously, nor do I want to look obviously like a man in a dress (the main point
of a drag queen). I act myself, which isn't overly fruity, camp or feminine, and I dress like a typical woman.

If someone outside LGBT circles sees a gay man in drag, they might assume that is a transgender person and therefore treat the issue of transgenderism as silly and as an act, rather than realising that true gender dysphoria is horrific for anyone who has to deal with it. 

I would almost go as far as saying that drag acts are (intentionally or unintentionally) mocking the plight of transgender individuals, and it is akin to dribbling and pretending to be someone with downs syndrome, and at the complete extreme (further than what I believe) akin to blackface.

I want to not hate drag queens, but I can't help but feel that do nothing but trivialise transgender people and make it harder for us, CMV.

"This concept as it applies to the Middle East is explained by former Stanford Research philosopher Jay Oglivy in a recent interview.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;persist_app=1&amp;v=J5ZcSwhPUzg)  He notes that while the Islamic State keeps their religious front, the economic factors have become a firmer root in their actions long-term.  

In Latin America, of course, this trend of shifting tides has been occurring on a smaller scale for some time, with Cartels on both the large scale and decentralized smaller scale destabilizing/continuously picking at the governments of Colombia and Mexico respectively.  The latter is divided currently between Cartels associated with either the Sinaola Federation, the Tierra Caliente, or the Tamaulipas.  

Even in Europe, where our modern definitions of the Nation-State were born, intrinsic faults with this structure are showing in the crisis of Greeks default today.  Whereas individuals or corporations would have only themselves to blame if they lent money to a poor investment or borrowed money they couldn't ever pay back, societies collected under the national governments of Germany and Greece have used political systems to push the issue of unplayable debt to its inevitable conclusion, and both are to blame.  Beyond the Greek Impasse&lt;/a is republished with permission of Stratfor(https://www.stratfor.com/weekly/beyond-Greek-impasse)  The problem here comes from the European issue of Social Democracy, which built up entitlements as ""rights"" to material goods, which would never be assumed in a private institution, where some degree of input is always expected for participation.  More often than not these kind of institutions form a meritocratic chain of command, where rational analysis means much more than opinion by a momentary ""popular vote"" substituted for fact. 

No firm of organization has been eternal, from hunter-gather, to city-state, to classical empire, to feudalism, to now with the ""nation-state."" As Jay said, the most likely form of socio-political organization to come is the Market State, where the ability of greater actors to achieve economic profit will determine the trend of global events, much more so than any state.  In Austrian Economics, one such version of these Market-States is known as the REA, or Rights Enforcement Agency, which could be a preferable theoretical alternative to the partly Theocratically driven Islamic State, if put into practice.   Such experimentation may be necessary if we wish for the future of civilization to remain stable.

"On Reddit, people like to shit on YouTube comments and how horrible they are. I personally don't find them bad, same for Reddit, but the complaints and reasons for why YouTube's is bad can apply to Reddit as well. 

Here are some of the complaints: 

Stupid/pointless comments. 

People arguing a lot

Shit, there is more, certainly more, but that's all I can think of right now because of a stupid brain fart. I don't know, reply with some other complaints. 

Looking at just those two, you can most definitely see that on Reddit. I mean, how many times have people bitched about ""pun threads"" how many people bitch about ""F"" comments and whatnot. As for arguing, oh boy do people argue a lot. Especially when feminism pops up. I can't say I'm not part of what others would consider ""the problem"", but oh well. So, those two complaints can be seen on Reddit and YouTube. 

There are other things, too, like the Reddit hivemind. You know, disagree with the majority, get downvoted to hell, see those askreddit threads about unpopular opinions, or things people dislike, and when someone dislikes something popular (Though, in those threads they tend to not get downvoted) people reply with ""2edgy4me"" which from my experience, also get upvoted/don't have a lot of people shitting on the person. That kind of a thing. 

On YouTube, it's pretty much the same. Disagree with the majority? As in, ""I didn't like this video because so and so"" and you'll get completely shit on. Constructive criticism or not. 

There is an important difference, though. On Reddit, this ""hivemind"" is more...effective, because downvotes (Depending on what you set the hide thing to, which you can change if you didn't know...least I'm pretty sure you can.) make the comment hidden and it's buried at the bottom of the thread so that your opinion shall not be questioned or challenged at all. It's like a combo of a hivemind and an echo-chamber. 

On YouTube, least I believe this is how it works, comments with lots of replies and likes are usually the first comments you see. A comment with a shit ton of comments can be above a post with lots of likes and just a few comments. This means that someone posting against the hivemind, and since people like to argue against people who appose their beliefs or what they like, it can result in a post saying ""This video is fucking awful because so and so"" being one of the first comments you see, somewhat getting rid of the hivemind and echo-chamber. It doesn't, but it looks like it does. 

So, that's what I think.

Edit: Oh, I should also add, if you want to change my view try to explain to me why one of those things cannot be applied to the other, or why one of those things is worse on YouTube than Reddit, and some things that are completely awful in the YouTube comments that Reddit doesn't have, or doesn't have a lot of.",{'boy'}
"NBC Universal to Donald Trump: You're fired!

NBC has decided they will no longer air the apprentice, or the Miss USA/universe contest. They have cut ties with Donald Trump altogether. 

But let's take a look at what trump said.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6QEqoYgQxw)

Now it was obviously stupid and false to call Mexican immigrants rapists. But I strongly suspect he was referring to human sex trafficking that happens across America's southern border, which is brutal. Sex trafficking is slavery.(https://www.dosomething.org/facts/11-facts-about-human-trafficking)

"When Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan land on Tatooine, they encounter Watto, a junk dealer who owns two slaves, Anakin Skywalker and his mother Shmi. When Qui-Gon learns he cannot buy them from Watto, he gambles for Anakin's freedom. 

I believe that Qui-Gon should have removed both Anakin and Shmi from Watto's control, using force (or the Force^haha ) if necessary. 

Since the Jedi are ""guardians of peace and justice"", they are presumably called to right moral wrongs. While slavery is apparently not illegal on Tatooine, it is nevertheless immoral, and Qui-Gon seems to recognize this. 

I realize that gambling on the podrace was necessary, since it would be wrong to take Watto's (non-living) property by force, even if he was dead. But I believe that once the race was over, and Qui-Gon had obtained the parts for the ship under the arrangement he and Watto made, Qui-Gon should have freed Shmi Skywalker using any means necessary. 

Change my view.

EDIT: You guys are sending in some great responses, I'll try to get them all after I get to work. There's a couple that keep coming up that I have issue with, though. 

Watto was a good master - Yes, but she's still a slave. Being a slave sucks bantha balls. 

Anakin was the only one who needed to be freed - Yes, but Shmi shouldn't have to be a slave forever because she's not important enough to the story. 

Qui-Gon couldn't free all the slaves - Yes, but that doesn't mean he shouldn't free the ones he can. 

Anakin needed to sever his emotional connections - Yes, but it seems like he would be more attached to his mother if she was still a slave billions of miles away than if she was living somewhere safe and comfortable. 

The Force wouldn't work on Watto - Toydarians are immune to mind tricks, not being hurled around the room with the Force like a ragdoll. 

EDIT: /u/Makes_Poor_Decisions changed my mind. Anakin would most likely not have become a Jedi if he could have lived with his mother and been free. While it still blows for Shmi, I can see the necessity of her being a slave for Anakin to be willing to leave her behind and become a Jedi.

"My city is really pretty normal for America. I don't know that many rednecks and everyone is pretty well educated. However I live in Alabama and our governor George Wallace literally stood in the schoolhouse door to prevent integration of the University of Alabama. Our current Chief Justice Roy Moore fought marriage equality so hard that my state's ban on same sex marriage had to be struck down twice. So even though I live in the city that designed and developed the rockets that put human beings on the moon, I am constantly exposed to the bad reputation that my state earns for itself.

Though I am a left-wing progressive and used to being an outspoken critic of the right-wing establishment here, I consider the South my home. I love it here and I love the people (mostly). Like a family they get on my nerves, but I wouldn't have it any other way.

My accent is lighter so it's kinda hard to exactly place where I'm from and when I say I am from Alabama I get a typical ""oh that's nice"" response and I assume they're just being polite. With the picture that the media paints of the South, I cannot help but feel that people stereotype me in advance. On reddit I know that we don't get much love, and I have seen threads and comments before that have received a lot of upvotes talking about how much better America would be without us. 

I know that there are awesome people everywhere and there are douchebags everywhere but this whole ordeal this week with confederate flag drama (which I do not support the use of the confederate flag) has made me seriously question my idea of my regional pride and how everyone else in the country thinks of us.

So in short I believe that the country as a whole has a very negative view of the South and I would like you to change my view. Thanks!

"It is pretty well known that the colombine shooters believed in natural selection, a key point of evolution. Just from their wiki(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Harris_and_Dylan_Klebold) they talk about natural selection in their journals, Eric Harris wore a shirt with the words ""natural selection"" written on it. It is clear that they believed strongly in this idea. 

The thug who shot up the church in SC believed strongly in white supremacy, he believed in racism and the confederate flag. 

I think that artificial selection was used as a justification for such crimes like eugenics, the holocaust ect. Believing that the weak die off is one of Darwins core concepts (Survival of the fittest, the most adapted live, the least adapted die). I think it is much more vile than the confederate flag, (which also used artificial selection, breeding slaves to fill labor shortages was most likely a thing(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_breeding_in_the_United_States) and breeding artificially is a form of artificial selection.

"It's my view that people that drive motorcylces and cars with those loud mufflers are simply inconsiderate in that they don't care about other's peace and quiet.  
  
I've always found them annoying, say you're reading or studying at a cafe and they roar by louder than an invading Mongolian horde. God forbid they stop at a light since now you're stuck listening to that ungodly chortle for a good minute or so.  
  
I'm a single parent now and live by a fairly well travelled road. They wake my baby up consistently, and he has a hard time with his sleeping habits.  
  
It's a choice to make your vehicle that loud, not a necessity. On top of that, the rider or driver does not have to hear his most of his own racket since most of the sound is projected backwards.  
  
These people are assholes. I wish I could wake them up every 15 minutes with their own stupid vehicle.

EDIT:   
  
I had no idea this post would get this big and, as much as I'd like to, I can't possibly hope to discuss this with all of you. Thank you to everyone, on both sides of the issue, for your reasoned and very interesting replies.  
  
The argument that got me closest to changing my view was surely that of safety. Other people are saying being loud is not as important for safety as actually driving well on a motorcycle, and this seems to be coming from cyclists as well, so unless I see some sort of peer reviewed study over anecdotal evidence that line of thinking isn't doing it for me.
  
My favorite arguments were those along the lines of ""It's a free country, you're the one that's being inconsiderate by expecting the riders to be silent."" The image of some tatted up Hell's Angel roaring through town and impinging on the hearing of 500 people and then screaming ""IM BEING OPPRESSED"" when someone suggests he tones down the throttle is simply delicious.  A special thank you to everyone who called me a pussy via PM. It's good to know you care so much.
  
I also learned that the sound that irritates so many of us so well is the sound of straight pipe exhausts. Cheers all!  
  
EDIT 2: 
  
/u/ToastitoTheBandito did manage to change my view on this. Here is the link to his comment  Thank you Toastito, and thank you for being considerate to others.
  
Just a caveat here, there's a few comments in this thread that highlight the problem with some drivers very well. I'm not gonna call anyone out by name but the gist is that I'm annoyed over a minor inconvenience and I should get over it, people like driving loud cars and they're gonna keep doing it.   
  
I don't think any new parent would call it a minor inconvenience after spending 30 minutes putting a baby to sleep only to be woken up 5 minutes into his nap by a purposely loud vehicle. But this post isn't JUST about me, or my baby. These drivers drive past countless people. People who are gravely ill. People who own dogs that will shit on the carpet because they're scared of the sound. Nursing homes. Someone with a migraine headache. People who work the night shift. And all these little acts, each one is a little fuck you from the driver. And all these little fuck yous add up to one huge mega fuck you to your community. People with empathy get mad at this not just because it inconveniences them but because they know it inconveniences many others as well and the act is seen as grossly disrespectful because of that.  
  
One PM I got said:  
  
I drive a loud car. Why? Because I like it.  
  
He doesn't take the time to think, ""How will my actions affect those around me? Is there any chance the thing I am about to do will harm someone, and, if that is the case, should I still do the thing?"" No, this person doesn't give a shit.

"Here's how I arrived at that number.

The measured net worth of the United States was $54.2 trillion in 2009.

The Koch Brothers, for a notorious example to start, have a net worth of $84.5 billion right now.

That means the Koch Brothers, by themselves, hold ~1/641th of the United States' wealth.

Doesn't sound like much? Well guess what: the number of billionaires in the United States is 536. We are #1 in the world in number of billionaires.

Bill Gates, at the top, has $79.3 billion USD. There's 2/641.

Warren Buffet, $72.3 billion USD. There's 3/641.

Carlos Sim, $72.9 billion USD. There's 4/641.

Larry Ellison, $50.8 billion USD. There's 5/641.

Jeff Bezos, $39.5 billion. 5.5/641.

Mark Zuckerberg, $34.8 billion USD. There's 6/641.

You see where I'm going with this? Throw in a couple hundred more billionaires, the fraction starts filling out. Just what percentage are we, the people? About nothing, it seems.

The total sum of all billionaire holdings in 2008 was $4.4 trillion. Only seven years later, it's $7.05 trillion. It's approaching double in less than a decade. Number of US billionaires in 2008: 470 (est.). Number in 2015: 536. This isn't a rising tide - it's just the same handful of people siphoning up the world's wealth.

Now I'll repeat that he measured net worth of the United States was $54.2 trillion in 2009. 1/5200th, per my belief for a wealth cap, would leave all of these listed US Citizens still billionaires - with exactly one billion each to their names. That would shrink their personal holdings to something less than 300/5200, which is a far more reasonable percentage (minimal) than the insane amounts they have now. They'd also live like kings for the rest of their lives, still, and so would their descendants - basically indefinitely.

I don't really have any specific care how they enforce this wealth cap, just that they do. I do know that the US can basically enforce this on the rest of the world, given how they basically assaulted Kim Dotcom in another country and seized his wealth - the US has more military might than all of the other countries combined, and about 7 billion people would support such an action. So it's definitely possible.

The negative consequences of so much wealth in so few hands are obvious - we're all dealing with the fallout in a collapsing country based on greed and exploitation.

But I am open to the idea that a wealth cap might have negative repercussions. Please CMV.

"I submit that Nye's public perception of 'being a scientist' is largely overblown by childhood memories. In his history, he had one 'scientific' accolade: he developed a device for Boeing years before he was every famous. Beyond that, he's just been a guy on TV reading from a script.

Even working at Boeing, his primary job was that of a TV persona: he made the training videos. 

I feel that Obama's use of Nye regarding global warming is strictly an appeal to the populace who grew up watching a kid show, not the opinion of a professional with a background in anything remotely related to climate. This doesn't mean I disagree with what he said, but only disagree with the idea that he should be trusted 'as a scientist'. He's a PR tool in that regard. He only parrots others' research - in everything he's done -not anything he actually observed through his own research. 

Further, simply having a degree in a scientific background makes you aware of that background (he has a bachelor's in engineering from Cornell), but that doesn't make you a scientist in the field. I know many people with degrees in one field who work in an entirely different field. A law degree doesn't make you a lawyer, for instance. My father has one and he's a retired contractor: never worked a legal case in his life. Nye's background hardly applies to the vast majority of his TV demonstrations and appearances.

And to the point of Carl Sagan, Neil Tyson, and others: these are actual scientists who have been published, who do(did) research in the field of their degree and beyond. Yes, these men are TV personas, but unlike Nye they're actually also scientists. 

So? Change my view. He's one of my childhood heroes too, but I simply can't accept him as a scientist. I feel that cheapens real work by real scientists.

Edit: Delta awarded(https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3bf41n/cmv_bill_nye_is_not_a_real_scientist_in_any/cslnyww), albeit not in a way I had in mind. It's technically correct, but we all know...(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hou0lU8WMgo)

To many of the comments: 

- Education is important and admirable, but that still doesn't make you a scientist in my view. If that's the standard of calling oneself a scientist while being displayed on news media as an expert to be listened to, then really, there's no measure for what an expert is in that regard.  

- There are many qualified scientists who are also good on TV: I still assert Nye's appearances were heavily caused by his association as the funny lab-coat and bow-tie 'science guy' and childhood memories, which is a manipulative and deceptive thing to do when appearing in support of public policy (regardless of my agreement and my own support of the same policy). That deception was not unintentional, but calculated. Herein lies my problem and reasoning for this post. I should note that this still stands as my view, and the delta awarded was awarded basically because I worded the post in a particular way. If anyone would like to address this view, I'd award another delta if the mods are okay with it. 

- I really, honestly think that comparing Nye and people like Neil Tyson and Carl Sagan is an insult to the latter two. That's like comparing your high school bio teacher to the same two men. That's utterly absurd in my mind: Tyson and Sagan contributed more to their fields than Nye ever could at this point. 

- Nye's only contribution I can see, which is the reason for the single delta awarded thus far, has been in the development and design of a hydraulic pressure resonance suppressor used for 747s, to this day. I concede this is a meaningful, scientific advancement for the public made by Bill Nye. ","{'his', 'men', 'he', 'him', 'heroes', 'guy', 'father'}"
"In the argument against gay marriage, people often use the ‘slippery slope’ argument that it’s legalisation would lead on to polygamous marriages also becoming legal. I’m not interested in arguing whether or not this will happen, but why it would be a bad thing if it did. This would be within the context of people being allowed to have multiple marriages, you would not automatically be married to your spouse’s other spouse, although you could choose to do this.

While I personally am not interested in polygamy, what's wrong with it? 

It's natural for humans to live in groups. 'Tribes' or 'family' whatever you would like to call it. I don't see anything wrong with families that have several adults to act as role models for children. I just can't see why it would be detrimental to children to be raised in that environment.

To be allowed to marry you need to be a consenting adult and in being one people can make their own relationship decisions. As long as there isn't a sex bias (e.g. men can have many wives but not the other way around), then I think that people can make their own decision about whether a polygamous relationship is something they want. They retain the right to get divorced if their spouse marries someone else when they want a monogamous marriage, just like people retain the right to get a divorce if their spouse cheats on them.

People sometimes argue against polygamous marriages saying that people are already legally allowed to have polygamous relationships, why get married? Because of the legal privileges associated with it? When I get married the legal benefits of being married are going to be way down on the list of reasons. Getting married is a way to show your love for someone. 

A big argument going against it is that the legality of it would be very complex. I don’t think that’s necessarily the case. If you died your possessions would be divided up amongst your spouses. Your children would either go to their other parent or be claimed by a next of kin who wants them, with fitness to look after them being determined by a court of law. As is the case currently with children whose parents die without leaving a will e.g. should they go to uncle A or uncle B? There are lots of examples of legal contracts which are binding to groups of people, why couldn’t this be applied to marriage? It could be encouraged, or even possibly mandatory, to have pre-nuptial agreements which define legal aspects of the marriage relating to property ownership, etc. prior to getting married if you’re married to more than one person. With current spouses also signing this document.

I’m not really that interested in ethical arguments. Why should one person’s ethics determine how other people live their lives? For example, I don’t think I would ever have an abortion for my own personal ethical reasons. That doesn’t mean that I’m against other people having the option.

I'm really interested to know if anyone has any good arguments against polygamous marriages. I think a lot of people are against them for their own personal ethical reasons, because they don’t want one themselves, rather than for an actually good, justifiable reason.

So please try to CMV! I’m going to try to reply to every direct response to me. I get really ped off when people cherry-pick arguments and ignore the ones that don't suit them. If there are a lot of responses it may take a while though so please be patient! But in saying that if you reply purely because I’ve committed to responding; if you put forth a low-effort comment you will get a low-effort answer.

Edit: I'm getting a bit tired so off to bed for me before anyone else comments &amp; I feel obliged to stay up and discuss this some more! I will definitely be back so please keep the discussion going! 

Edit2: Right, there's a fair few replies so I will be going through them. Although a lot of later comments are using arguments that have been used before I'm still determined to reply to all of them. It may take me a while as I unfortunately have other things that I need to be doing, such is life, so I will get to you eventually!

Edit3: I have finally awarded a delta! Apologies to anyone whose comment I missed, but thank you all for being part of the conversation. It was very entertaining and I definitely feel a lot more informed. So you don't have to scroll down &amp; find the explanation for my delta, I'll give it here: 
""While I still think there is nothing wrong with polygamous relationships &amp; the concept of some sort of legal commitment, this couldn't be marriage. You could have some kind of legally binding partnership with multiple partners which has some of the benefits of marriage, such as recognition of the partnership affecting things like visitation rights and a legal claim to be next of kin, but this wouldn't be the same as marriage as we have it now. It's not so much about when people in the marriage are living together, but if things later needed to be taken apart. There is just no way to predict every possibility for a pre-nuptial agreement, and the situation could get so complex that you couldn't have a standard that could be fallen back on every time.""

"I make this CMV in response to the claim I see on reddit by Sanders supporters which basically states: ""Most Americans don't understand what socialism actually is."" My argument is that Americans absolutely understand the meaning of the word and its Sanders and his supporters who either don't understand it, or are trying to change its meaning as it is currently accepted in the USA.

From the dictionary: Socialism is a social and economic system characterized by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy, as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system. This is socialism in the traditional sense and what I believe most Americans think of when they hear the word. Now I understand that socialism is a broad term and can encompass many different ideas, however the core idea of the term is the same: Government control of the means of production. 

The argument now becomes that just like we don't have a fully capitalist economic model, Sanders does not want a fully socialist economic model. To me this means that instead of having a capitalist system where the goal is to have as little government intervention as possible (within reason), Sanders and his supporters want a socialist system where the goal is to have as much government intervention as possible (again within reason). This is how I, and many other Americans view socialism. So while Sanders may not at any time be pushing for some sort socialist revolution, he is still pushing for a massive increase in government regulation of industry. 

The problem I have with Sanders and his supporters is that this isn't socialism to them. They see seemingly every government service we provide is a form of socialism and that being against socialism also means being against firemen and public school teachers. This is nonsense. As I've stated above we don't have a fully capitalist society today and there are social services that we expect the government to provide and pay for through taxation. However, these services are something we've come to expect from the government and most Americans have never considered their existence a form of ""socialism"" before the Sanders crowd came along and claimed that they are. It seems like they are trying to change the definition of the word as it has been accepted by Americans for decades, if not longer.

To summarize, I believe that simply being for more government provided services such as universal healthcare does not make you a socialist.  I (and I'd argue most Americans) believe that being a socialist means that in your ideal state you would like to have the government in control most of if all means of production. I therefore state that Bernie Sanders is wrong when he claims that just because he wants higher taxes and more government spending that he is a socialist. I also state that the way most Americans view the word is closer to its actual meaning.

"I've been reading comments about hypothetical situations where someone's twin has had sex with his sibling's spouse without the spouse realizing it's the sibling instead, until it's too late. People will call that sibling a rapist. In other similar occasions, for example in kinky situations where the spouse is waiting in the bedroom blindfolded, and someone other than the intended lover takes their place in the act.

Those are false pretenses. The spouse wants to have sex with a specific person, and is fooled into having sex with someone else.

If that's rape, then so is leaving a prostitute without paying her after sex. She clearly exchanged sex for money, and if you didn't intend to pay her then it was false pretenses and you're a rapist. Not to mention a thief.

"I want to start by I believe we made horrible mistakes once we entered Iraq. The biggest being the dissolution of the Iraq army and the laws that were passed to essentially keep them out, there were many many more but this is the biggest.



The invasion of Iraq was a good thing in these ways. Sadaam was a true representation of evil. All of his evils need not be explained one by one, but I think it's universally held he was evil and poison to the country he was ruling.



 As far as WMD, bush had conflicting reports as to whether they were there or not. Even if the reports leaned in the favor he did not presently own, there was evidence he had been trying to obtain WMD. Should we wait till he had obtained such to invade where he would surely use his obtained WMD in war? He also has the history of using WMD in war. He also stated in his trial, he did give the illusion to having WMD because he was worried if he didn't and it was known Iran would invade. He also I believe in 1998, not sure this exact year, refused to cooperate with having people come into the country to examine if he had WMD or not something he agreed to do in the early 90's.



He was also giving diplomatic immunity to terrorist and war criminals. He might not have had direct ties to bin laden but was aiding other terrorist and war criminals in other ways. The war on terror was not just about bin laden but to all terrorist organizations. 




To summarize, He wAs a terrible person to be in power, giving the illusion he had WMD by his own admission and history of being willing to use such, and aiding terrorist and war criminals. This was a good thing to strip him of his power. With that said we made many mistakes after the invasion. As far as setting up the governing body, dissolving the iraq army,etc. but as far as the decision to invade it was the right thing to do, and it lessened the places terror could operate in that part of the world. Also showing USA would not tolerate these many threats, not one or two, as other leaders have done,  but the many violations sadaam has committed will not be tolerated. Change my views

"I believe that people who have sex with underage teenagers should not be prosecuted if both parties admit that the older didn't have knowledge that the younger was underage.

This is what happens if you are charged with statutory rape:

 charged with a felony

 1+ year of prison and/or fine

 possible required sex offender registration

A few downsides to becoming a registered sex offender in my state (Washington):

 Sex offenders often cannot own or control personal computers. 

 If community corrections officers permit access to computers, they normally must have blocks that prevent access to specific sites.

 Offenders also cannot have contact with magazines, videos, telephone sites or anything else with pornographic content.

 Offenders cannot move without permission.

 You must inform your CCO of romantic relationships. 

 Some offenders may be required by their CCO to disclose their criminal history to their families and friends.


 Community corrections officers must approve your residence and living arrangements.

 You often must remain within specified geographic boundaries.

 You cannot purchase, possess or consume any mind or mood altering substances, including alcohol or drugs that haven’t been prescribed by doctors.


 Offenders must allow their community corrections officers to inspect every part of their homes.

 Offenders must disclose information about their conviction(s) to potential adult sexual partners before beginning sexual relationships.

 Felony offenders may not own, use or possess firearms or ammunition.

 Offenders cannot patronize any establishment in the sex industry, including topless dancing clubs, sex toy outlets or houses of prostitution.

I just don't think it's fair for anyone to be prosecuted for a crime that they did not know they were committing, a crime that someone else tricked them into committing by intentionally misrepresenting his or her age. ",{'his'}
"A shocking claim, perhaps? Here is my evidence:
-Michael Caine in one of the most auspicious performances of his career

-A song from the theatrical version called ""The Love is Gone"", wherein Belle breaks young Scrooge's heart as old Scrooge watches in despair

-The Great Gonzo as Charles Dickens

-Consistently amazing songs and instrumentals

-Miss Piggy and Kermit give a tearjerking performance as the Cratchits

-Scrooge's bookkeepers complain that their assets are frozen.

Reasons it is better than other selected Christmas movies:

-Miracle on 34th street is super cheesy

-A Christmas Story lacks the emotional punch of MCC

-Bad Santa, while a good movie, can't be enjoyed by younger audiences, and isn't family an intregral part of Christmas?

-The Santa Claus is pretty good, but is depressing for most of the movie (custody battles, questions of sanity, child abuse)

"The main argument I have heard for not letting foreign-born naturalized citizens from running for U.S presidency is the fact that that person may still harbor sentimental ties with that foreign country. As such, in matters concerning that country, that person may not put the U.S's best interest first. However, let me try to dispute that argument by using myself as an example.

I was born in India and raised by Indian parents. When I was 3 my parents moved permanently to America but under current U.S law, no matter what I do, I can never run for U.S presidency. However, my brother can since he was born in the U.S 3 years after we moved here. Now both my brother and I have been raised by the exact same parents in the same household with the only difference being that he is 6 years younger than me and he was born in the U.S. For both of us, our first language was our native language (not english), we still live by Indian culture and tradition in our house, we have made equal visits to India to visit relatives, and we have equal ties to India. So why does it make sense that my brother has the potential to become the President of the United States and I have no chance at all when we both have an equal bias towards India.    

Here's another example why I think it is ridiculous that foreign-born citizens cannot become president. Let's take the opposite of my situation. Suppose a person was born in America to Chinese parents but soon afterwards moved to China. He lives there for 30 years and then moves back to America. After 14 years of living in the U.S, he is capable of running for presidency if he so wishes. In this case, this person has lived the vast majority of his life in China, almost as if he was simply born there, and he is capable of being the President of United States. Despite the fact that I'm probably more suited to be president than him (from the fact that I was raised here, lived most of my life here, went to school here from kindergarten to college, etc) it is still impossible for me to run.   

In short, I'm saying that place of birth doesn't say much about your affiliations or familiarity of American culture. Instead of how it is currently, I believe that anyone who lives in the U.S, whether natural-born or not, should be able to run for presidency and the public gets to determine through voting if they actually become the President.

"I was raised Catholic but now firmly believe that agnosticism is the only religious view that makes sense given our limited knowledge of the universe.

I generally dislike organized religion for creating an either-or-view of divinity. Either you accept my god or yours, my rules or your own. People are often raised to be a certain religion from a young age, so their religion is almost wholly contingent on their upbringing, location, etc. I think it is foolish to say ""my god is the correct god"" or ""my god is the only god"" when others just as vehemently believe their own god story. If anything, I can accept the more Unitarian philosophy that each religion's god story is pointing towards the same divine force. I am against the idea of a personified god, but I can understand the notion that there is some binding, transcendent force in the universe. I think one must abandon what John Rawls calls the arbitrariness of fortune (i.e. the societal and environmental preconditions that have shaped you) and try to consider religion more objectively. In doing so, I find it hard to choose one religion over another. As I said, I believe if there is a god, it is more of a force than a ""he"" or ""she"", and it exists at the intersection of religious thought rather than firmly in the confines of any one school.

I also think it is foolish to be completely convinced that there is no god at all. The burden of proof may be on the people who believe there is a god, but it is equally impossible to deny the existence of one. If you view god more as a unifying force than a gray-bearded old man doling out punishments from on high, I think it is perfectly feasible that such a force may exist.

Some view agnosticism as an admission of defeat. I think such a level of resignation is necessary. We simply cannot know if there is a god or godlike force at play in the universe. Though I generally reject organized religion, I think it is impossible to entirely rule out the possibility of a god figure, and I do not think this remains a possibility in my mind solely because I fear death or want there to be something more (i.e. my desire for survival). I just look at the universe and our limited knowledge of it and think maybe. Maybe there is something else. Maybe there is a transcendent reason why so much of our existence is so cyclical, why nature is so beautiful to us, etc. But maybe there isn't. We simply cannot know. CMV.

"In most cases of rape accusations, there is no witness to the alleged crime.  Accordingly, if the two parties to the alleged crime have opposing stories as to what events occurred, there is no on to corroborate either person's perception.  So the only way to determine which person's story is most likely to be accurate is to gather information from periods of time during which there were witnesses and compare those eye-witness accounts to the stories told by the parties to the alleged crime.

So if a girl says she was raped, and a guy says they had consensual sex, what types of information would be helpful from eyewitnesses?  Well, the actions and behaviors of the parties both before, and after, the alleged rape would be relevant, wouldn't they?

While you can never know for certain whether the woman consented in the moment, any of her actions or behaviors that happened before the alleged rape that indicate ""interest"" in the guy or ""interest"" in sex would provide some indication as to whether or not the sex was consensual:

 Was she hanging on the guy at a bar, or trying to avoid him?

 Were they in a relationship that consisted of frequently going out to a bar and then having sex at his place?  Did they go out to a bar and then go back to his place in this instance?  Or was this a stranger that she met at the bar that night?

 Was she making sexually suggestive comments to him earlier in the night, or was she rolling her eyes and his sexually suggestive comments?

By the same token, her actions and behaviors after the alleged rape can be indicative of whether or not the sex was consensual:

 Did she leave his place in the middle of the night, or did she stay over, make breakfast for him and go out on a date with him again the next week?

 Did she go to birthday party the next and a smile and laugh, or did she lock herself in her room for 2 days?

 Did she call a rape crisis line the next day, or did she go out and buy a new car?

Now let me be clear, just because you were hanging on a guy at a bar doesn't mean you consented to sex.  Just because you had sex with a guy previously, doesn't mean that you consented to sex this time.  Just because you make sexually suggestive comments to a guy, doesn't mean you consented to sex.  Just because you make a guy breakfast and go on more dates with him doesn't mean you consented to sex.  Just because you appear happy the next day doesn't mean you consented to sex.  And just because you fail to call a rape crisis center, it doesn't mean you consented to sex.

But there is no way, in most cases, to determine whether or not you actually did consent to sex or not.  And the answers to the types of questions enumerated above can provide support to indicate whether or not it was likely you consented.  And determine consent is the only way to determine whether or not a rape actually occurred.  And if there is no rape, then there can be no ""victim blaming"" by these questions because there is no ""victim"" to blame.","{'his', 'him', 'guy'}"

"Where I live, there are quite a few two-lane streets (one lane going either way) that tend to get quite busy during the morning and afternoon rush hours. A trend I've noticed is that, on occasion, cars will stop in the middle of one of the lanes and put on their blinkers, indicating their desire to turn left onto a road that branches off the two-way street.

What those cars don't seem to get is that the road is BUSY. These cars often spend many minutes sitting in the road, left blinker on, while watching a flood of cars zoom by in the other direction. In the meantime, they back up traffic behind them for MILES and piss off every single driver behind them. Only after multiple minutes, one car in the flood of traffic going the other direction will take pity on the hundred or so poor saps stuck behind this makeshift roadblock, slow to a halt, and allow the turning driver to pass through. 

Never once in my life have I seen the driver trying to turn left actually realize just how badly he's holding traffic up behind him and abandon his attempted left turn. It's always someone in the opposite lane who manages to find the shred of empathy to let him pass and release the flood of cars.

But enough about the rant - I'm of the opinion that this should be illegal, and deserves ticketing if caught (though, obviously, by forcing the car to drive forward and pull over in an area that won't block traffic further). An action like this disrupts the flow of traffic and ruins everyone's commute.

Note: Sometimes I will refer to the ""Confederate flag"" by its proper name, the battle flag of Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia (it was never actually adopted by the C.S.A.)

When I first heard of the ""Confederate Flag"" flying on the grounds of the S. Carolina Capitol, I was surprised how many people thought it was actually flying from the Capitol building, when in fact it is flying from a 20 foot pole next to a 30 foot memorial to Confederate dead.


I later heard of Washington and Lee University in Lexington, VA removing the ""Confederate Flag"" from Lee Chapel in 2014. Lee Chapel is a chapel, museum, auditorium, and crypt where Robert E Lee's body is actually buried. I thought it odd that people would be offended enough to push for the battle flag of Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia to be removed from the building that houses Lee's body and bears Lee's name, on the campus of a private university that also bears Lee's name but that they weren't offended enough to push for his body to be removed, or for the chapel or the school to be renamed.

This made me think that if the argument for removing the ""Confederate flag"" from public view is that it has been so thoroughly tainted by slavery, the KKK, and the Dixiecrats that it cannot even be used in memoriam of Confederate dead, or even for the one general by whom the flag was actually flown, then we might as well just remove all government funding for Confederate memorials, physically move them off public and government ground, and even go so far as to purge places like Washington and Lee University of all ""Confederate taint."" 

That to me seems like the logical conclusion and most honest position to take. I'm open to being convinced that Confederate memorials and statues should be permitted to remain on public ground, even government ground, and maintained with taxpayer funding and that private universities don't have to completely remove all evidence of Confederate influence. I'm also willing for someone to CMV that people who push to remove the ""Confederate flag"" (but not the monuments, etc) do so because the flag is an easy target and they lack the conviction to push for a full purge....not because they actually have thoughtfully concluded that there is a substantive difference between the battle flag of Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia and the Confederate memorial it flys by.

As a sidebar: I'd also be interested to see if anyone who thinks the ""Confederate Flag"" should come down believes that it is possible to design a memorial in such a way that treats the dead with respect without glorifying the cause. Something like a Vietnam War Memorial for the South? Or, is it simply impossible to have a memorial for Confederate dead without being as insulting and divisive as flying the ""Confederate Flag""? I think that's an interesting discussion no one is having.

Edit: Since the comparison to Nazi Germany is made so frequently, I thought I'd ask the good folks or at /r/Germany for some help. Here is a thread about how Germany handles their WWII war dead.

"First off this assumes a Compatiblist view of free will. I believe that there is no ""natural"" free will. We are all chemical systems, and, as such, all decisions we make are really the inevitable result of the laws of physics. Even assuming quantum mechanics adds some amount of randomness, our actions are still the result of their nature, and not the other way around. Although this is the nature of the universe, I don't use it to inform my morality. It is just an observation of: What must happen will happen. To try and derive a morality from this would be fatalistic and essentially nihilistic in its practice. Since I don't think we know what will happen, in a lot of cases, that we can pursue what ought to happen and that that will make what must happen and what ought to happen become one in the same. And it is this ability to pursue that, with a mind that FEELS independent of nature that is the important thing. As long as we FEEL we can think independently of nature, we effectively can to it. And that's all that matters

-

The other definition of free will, our ability to take actions independent of the intent of others, and independent of impulse, is alive, although not absolute. We are all hugely the product of the manipulations of other individuals. Our parents, our friends. We can deviate from them, but often we won't through pressure, apathy, or just our brain socially indoctrinating itself to fit in with its surroundings. But, to varying degrees, we each have free will, that is a will independent of the will of others. And some wills are more free than others, but all wills are at least a LITTLE free.

-

But, if there did exist a god with omnipotence and omniscience, then I believe that it is logically impossible for free will of that second kind to exist in a universe in which that God exists. That second kind of free will can exist because of two things: 1: No will belongs to a conscious being with enough power, in either itself or the resources it controls, to completely control the will of others. 2: No will belongs to a conscious being with enough knowledge, in either itself of the resources it controls, to know how to completely control the will of others, or how its actions will effect the will of others. If either one of these conditions are met, then free will is severely compromised. And if both of these conditions are met then it is completely compromised. A God with omniscience will know EXACTLY how each of his actions is going to effect the universe upon which it acts. And if that God is also omnipotent, then he can cause anything he wishes to occur to occur exactly as he wants it. He would be able to and know exactly how to tailor the nature of any universe he creates or comes into contact with in such a way that the events he wants to unfold, must unfold exactly as he wants them to in that universe. He would not be oblivious to the consequences of any action he took, thus there could be no unintended consequences. Everything must therefore be intended by his will. But free will, as I said in the beginning of the second paragraph, is our ability to make actions that are independent of the intent of others. Therefore, free will cannot exist in a universe in which there exists a conscious will that is omniscient and omnipotent. OTHER than that of the god itself.","{'his', 'he'}"

Kubrick makes intended changes to the books plot seemingly to down play the true evil of the hotel. Take for instance the different endings. In the book the hotel is destroyed, and the movie it's left standing. If the hotel is as evil in the book as it is in the movie, the hotel should have been destroyed.


Take the maze scene. Kubrick places this maze scene in where Danny is chased by the insane gone over the edge jack. Where as the book jack is possessed by the hotel and chases Danny through the halls, his voice and demeanor is extremely unfamiliar to Danny. Jack seemingly goes over the edge as opposed to being possessed by a the hotel. 



Last example is the hedges. The hotel can control the hedges and bring them to life. As Danny's shine gets stronger and fuels the hotels power the hedges go from just moving their positions, to being able to attack the occupants. This is left out seemingly to downplay the hotels capabilities. That's as good place to start as any so Change my views.

A person is born of either the male or female sex just as they are born into a certain race. These things are determined by your genes. However, the concepts of gender(as apposed to sex) and race are pretty much social constructs; and if it's socially acceptable for a person who strongly feels that they identify as the opposite gender to claim they are that gender, then it should also be socially acceptable for someone to claim they are of a different race if they strongly feel that they identify as such.

"Im probably going to ramble on and such so i will make my point clear from the way i see it. Also my rhetoric is not going to be nice because its sort of half a rant too. I guess this is directed at a sort of liberal/progressive crowd, but can apply to right wing people too.

Ever since atheism and anti-theism movement sprung up on reddit we have been bashing it. Some of those reasons was correct. I believe atheists used too much rhetoric such as ""free thinker"", ""skeptic"", ""reason"" and ""logic"" to push their agenda. And we used to (USED TO) have neckbeards spewing some obnoxious shit. And i agree they come off as cringy. But in general, mockery of religion is fun, really fun and FAIR! We laugh at bullshit ideas all the time.

""im an atheist but please be tolerant, let them believe"" or ""People believe different things"" or something similar.

-We have such an agenda of tolerating christians because in the west because the majority is still christian, this also influences ""tolerant atheists"" subconsciously

-We tolerate Islam because ""that is the religion those people in them middle east believe in"" so it would make us racist to criticize it. Like i get it Fox news is racist, but i dont have to be racist because i critizice Islam. Its like the people who try to tolerate Islam somehow think its racist to criticize it, failing to see that there is a diverse spectrum of people who believe in Islam and not just middle eastern people. Calling people racist for critizicing Islam is such a high level of mental gymnastics that i cant even. 

-We cant critizice Jews because that would make us literally Hitler. (I actually understand this one though)

-Mormons are made fun of, but mostly they get the same treatment as christians ""let people believe what they believe"".

-We dont respect the views of other-kin, astrologists, parapsychologists, flat earthers etc.

Because?

They are not a majority, nor taught to us before we could write. That is what i think most people choose to ignore. We dont have people spewing tolerance of religion because we have some genuine need to spare someones feelings. Its because christianity is popular, based on faslehood and people feel like their beliefs are under attack.

When was the last time you saw someone going out of their way to defend a person who claimed to be a wolf? Oh, wait they get laughed at and mocked universally. Guy claims to believe hes literally drinking the blood of christ? Someone mocks him and gets labeled a fedora neckbeard.

Like seriously if someone tells you they believe in unicorns you can probably laugh in their face like ""HAHAHA, you believe that?"" and no one would bat an eye. However, have long debates where you try to go into detail of the problems surrounding religion and trying to debunk it? Richard Dawkins and speakers like him get called intolerant. As if a desire to uphold truth is somehow wrong because people get their little feelings hurt.

The way i see it religion is as fake as astrology or unicorns. But there is no one defending the latter. Religion is bullshit with good PR. I would prefer to keep laughing at people who think they are wolfs, but with a world where no one is trying to pretend like religion needs some sort of handicap from society to not ""hurt precious feelings"". I should be able to find religion absurd without being labeled ""Euphoric"" or ""fedora wearing neckbeard"". 

I wish we could call out bad ideas no matter how many people believed in it. I want eqaulity when it comes to mocking things. The way i see it now religion has some sort of taboo of criticism that is protecting it. The way i want our society to change its view is  for people to watch all three videos  below and laugh. Just for the sake of equality. Sincerely, i live in Norway so i recieve minimal damage from religion. I just wish religion did not have to have some protective shield and having it be taboo to criticize it because they will cry the loudest when mocked.

"With the advent of self-driving vehicles, the unavoidable will become clear: people are terrible drivers, and operating your own car is unacceptably reckless if a better alternative exists.  I see the coming timeline like this: (copied from a reply to another post)  

2-5 years: The last major technological hurdles (driving in rural/poorly documented areas, driving in adverse conditions, cost) are resolved. Cars are now demonstratively better drivers than humans in all situations. (note: may be a very liberal estimate.)  
4-6 years: The first round of legal cases involving driverless cars is settled, producing a precedent that makes driving your own car very risky. A collision between two vehicles, one self driving the other not, almost always results in fault to the driver. Causing an accident while operating a car with unused self-driving capability makes drivers extremely vulnerable to being sued.  
5-10 years: Safety studies, overwhelmingly favorable to self-driving cars, lead to the option becoming mandatory on all new vehicles. insurance companies, burned by litigation, offer premium rates to those who never switch off the driverless option, while increasing rates on drivers who elect to operate their cars manually. Soon the difference between these rates becomes enormous.  
10-15 years: Commercial driving is entirely automated. Cabs, buses, trucks, trains, ""driver"" becomes an obsolete profession. The savings in both wages and liability is simply too tremendous to allow any non-automated fleet to remain competitive.  
15-20 years: Studies conclusively show that the only traffic casualties that still occur are exclusively due to human operator error. It becomes evident that driving your own car is unthinkably dangerous, like drunk driving at night with no headlights or seatbelts. Safety laws are passed that effectively outlaw operating your own vehicle.   
  
By the time my nephew is 15-16, controlling a car will be something that only hobbyists do, and never on public roads.  Very few cars will be privately owned, rather they will be operated by private or municipal transportation services.

"So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training but knowing some of them personally they really take it all as some joke- not saying that all volunteers do -but I think that if your going to be in charge of saving someones life and are going to risk your own life you should be a paid professional.

Other than the argument that paying firefighters is too expensive for the state why the heck else do all these small towns rely on locals to just figure it out themselves.

Edit: 

Please see thndrchld and Mine's conversation below

And as far a what I said by taking it as a joke I know a kid that joined because he wanted to shack-up in a fire engine, An ex of mine's grandfather was the long running lead volunteer fighter and often joke that if a N's house caught fire he'd let them burn- these are the things that went on in my small home town.
And that is one of the main reason that i feel this should be handled by professionals, not just and guy off the street with his own agenda.- so one more question- if you were volunteering with either of the guys I mentioned what would you do? and how could you have those people removed?

celeritas365 made a good point

What about mixed? In my town we have some professionals and some volunteers. Some of the volunteers are more for support and can't go into a burning building. The stuff that happens outside is still important. Why pay a full firefighter when you don't need all of his or her skills? Also, much of what fire departments do is checking for fires when a house alarm goes off and doing small yet important things like chemically treating gasoline spills from auto accidents so they don't catch fire. While important, I don't see why a team of ALL professional firefighters need to do these tasks.

I think maybe thats what i mean more- There should be professionals at all depts, no ALL volunteer depts should exist.- that also solves the money issue with for example 1 pro for every 5 volunteers.

Ada1629 Also had a good point on my thoughts
However, I feel uncomfortable with people working for free - it becomes suspect to me that something more nefarious is going on

"In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they don't want to is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to things that are unacceptable to do to a person without his or her permission. Telling someone that they can't get a medical procedure done (or, likewise, telling that they HAVE to get a medical procedure done) is just as awful as is dictating how they were their hair or how they dress. In that same vein, what makes it okay in our society for your significant other to dictate who you sleep with? 

Sex in our society is a recreational activity enjoyed by most adults in at least some capacity. People dictating what their SOs do for fun in their free time seems rather controlling. Adults should feel free to do what their bodies what they wish as long as they aren't physically forcing another person to do something. Forcing another person to only have sex with you seems to me like an awfully controlling behavior and takes away the body autonomy that they should have. 

I can understand if a couple decides between the two of them that would like to sleep exclusively with each other. It's just surprising to me at times that it is the norm to be mad enough at your SO to break up with them if they have sex with someone outside of the relationship. I understand that people cheat all the time, but open relationships just seem to be the exception rather than the norm. 

If you want a monogamous relationship and your SO sleeps with someone else, then you shouldn't be mad at your SO. You should simply realize that you guys want different things out of a relationship and part ways. Getting angry would be controlling your SO and taking away his or her own control over his or her own body. 

And just for clarification: I am not saying that everyone should go out and cheat on their SOs. I am more stating that it should be normal and acceptable for people to have sex with people outside of a two person relationship for no other reason than that it is oddly controlling to insist that your SO sleep with no one besides you. 

Also, I wanted to point out that I am purposefully not using particular genders. It is just as bad to for a woman to tell a man he can't have sex outside the relationship as it would be if a man told a woman the same thing.

"I will start by I have struggled with this concept since it has been brought to my attention. I know this movie extremely well, better than I should, and have previously debated just about every scene. Not to say the this conclusion is right but to say I do know the film and the characters well. 



My basic theory stems from, The movie constantly allures to what and how magic is done, which has nothing to do with 'real magic' but with deceit. That's what the machine is deceit.  Will give  a summary of my theory now, leaving out the beginning and end, and details as my post will be too long for any interest. I will elaborate on the beginning and end , and details once the discussion begins.



So Borden does have a twin, tesla is real, angiers visits are fabricated from the diary and his ending speech being as such. Upon Angier capturing Fallon and receiving the key to Borden's diary(tesla) is where I will start. Angier visits Tesla finding out there is no answer to Borden's secret( Angiers original motive), and tesla has no ""magic"". So he begins to come up with away to frame Borden, not just kill him, but ruin his reputation and acquire custody of his daughter. He uses the fact Borden has sent him to tesla, to begin his frame up. He uses a useless tesla machine to add flair to an old trick, and spark interest in Borden. Angier also needs ""real magic"" to obtain a theater, no simple trick will do, as Borden hs already ruined his reputation. He uses a double to pull off his trick, with the illusion of being transported. He doesn't drown his double every night just the night of the murder. To ensure Borden will be confused he uses the element of mysterious tanks being transported from the theater every night, otherwise Borden will easily see he is using a double but with the mysterious tanks he sparks enough interest from Borden to want to see backstage, as this is vital for the frame up to work. 



Angier is the pledge and turn and root(or other double if you prefer) is the prestige, ie on the balcony. Angiers motive at this point is no longer magic or the applause it's simply to frame borden. Borden makes multiple appearances at the show wearing a disguise. Angier needs to spot and identify this disguise in order to carry on with the frame up, which is why he doesn't do the frame up the first night he enters the theater, and eventually Angier does discover Borden. Knowing his routine and the fact he will come again because he hasn't been picked to view the machine or backstage, he sets the frame up. Seeing Borden enter the theater he tells his assistant to pick Borden out of the crowd that night, also telling root he will be the pledge and turn for the transported man ( not the other tricks) on this night. As Borden is being picked from the crowd, Angier and root switch, the frame up plays out Angier flees the theater. This is the jist will elaborate further on the end scene and the like upon the discussion beginning.



I will add a few of the questions about the machine working theory that I have, which can be answered by my theory. These questions could be preluded with ""if the machine works""



What is the tank Caine and Angier are pushing during the ending scene? If if the last clone is in the morgue, and the tank had been broken to extract the clone what tank are they pushing?



Why store the clones? What not rid of them every night?


What is the air bubble at the end in the only visible tank.



How did Angier gain full control of both his legs while drowning? The movie goes through some length to show how damaged it is, why do this if it's not meant to be.a clue



If Borden sends angiers to tesla, it's his plan, why wait till he has  captured Fallon to give him Teslas name, why not give it to him when he gives Angier the diary?



I have more of my theory to share, and more question to ask those who disagree it this is already too long. Looking for reasonable, logical, light hearted debate, so bring it on reddit change my views

"Hello /r/changemyview, I'm here today because I believe Islam is an inherently intolerant religion that not only condones violence against non believers but actually commands it. To this end I believe that Islam will never be able to fully reconcile with the West and that humans in general have a moral and ethical responsibility to eradicate it. Of course I do not condone violent means. Quite frankly I believe that if the US and other 1st world secular countries (such as in Europe) began to fund universities all over the Middle East that Islam would fall apart naturally, as its persistence throughout the world is predicated upon ignorance and the valuing of the Ummah above all else. That being out of the way, Id like to breakdown my indictment of Islam into three main points:

1. The first is the Islamic theology of abrogation, which is the idea that God can contradict Himself and change reality from the rules He previously set; this is dangerous for many reasons - one can argue that the surah saying to respect other people is chronologically prior to God's commandment to destroy the infidels. 

2. I would say is the ummah (=nation), which is actually a departing from the Semitic thought of what a community was until that point (Syriac and Christian Arabs use the word for ""people"" instead). The very idea of the Ummah creates an unreconcilable ""us v. them"" mentality, inherently incompatible with multiculturalism or even coexistence. It also perpetuates ideas of petty tribalism and poverty (by denouncing the importance of education and societal advancement in benefit of reproduction and growing the Ummah). Which yields the last -

3. Jihad is much more dangerous than people think, despite it being a buzz word. Jihad as-saif, or ""struggle of the sword"", is the idea that anyone in the common body of Islam is obliged to join in physical resistance against infidels anywhere they threaten Islam. This is basically the theological justification of the aggression of Al Qaeda, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, ISIS, etc. It's very dangerous because the Western mind compartmentalizes groups into nations - this transcends national boundaries because many Islamic fundamentalists deny states even legitimately exist. So for instance when Afghanistan was fighting against the USSR, there were muslims from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Morocco, etc. fighting for Islam in Afghanistan. Likewise, these same countries (even muslims from the US and Britain) have joined in fighting those they view as evil secular leaders, such as Bashar al-Assad.

I know what most of you will respond, that I am a bigot who cannot see over the shortcomings of other Abrahamic faiths like Christianity and Judaism, and that just as many atrocities have been committed under those faiths. I would say to you that these acts were committed by representatives of the faith but not sanctioned by the faith. Christianity itself dos not sanction violence, but Islam does. Jesus taught to love your enemies, and Mohammed sought to destroy them. This leaves no room for interpretation and very specifically calls all Muslims to fight against enemies of the faith (read: Non-Muslims) wherever they may be.

With regard to my three points, people would argue that the first point is not an issue because Islam knows the proper order of the Surat, and that the only reason why God commanded Mohammed to kill everyone is because they were threatened and it is analogous to the Israelites being commanded to fight surrounding tribes. To this I would emphatically say ""Yea, right.""

To my second point, they would say that nothing about the idea of the Ummah excludes non-Muslims, they're just not equal, but that's every religious society. They might even go so far as to say that the Ummah isn't even necessary for Islam, just Muslim dominant countries. I passionately disagree with this, and Islam CANNOT exist as a minority religion anywhere by its own nature. Wherever it exists it seeks to establish Sharia, and must be the ruling religion at least by its own mechanics. I don't have the source here but a recent survey stated for instance that 4 out of 10 Muslims in the UK seek to institute Sharia law. And there are already muslim arbitrated courthouses in the country. This desire to force sharia is not a product of extremism but rather an actual tennet of the faith, and that difference is crucial.

Lastly they would say that jihad as saif is only one type of jihad (the one normally portrayed in the media) and that only extremists would commit this act. To them I would say that they are bad Muslims because technically their prophet and hadith commands this form. M Surah 9:5, also known as the Verse of the Sword, proves this.
Well that isn't a very strong argument just because Christianity doesn't inherently sanction use of violence, more so examples like the crusades were a specific historical incident (not to mention they killed other Christians, sacking Constantinople and killing many Greeks, Copts and Syriacs whereas at least Copts and Syriacs have lived centuries under the yoke of Islam with no theology of violent reaction).

Islam is very much a material reality of political philosophy. No one is an Islamic theologian; the biggest names in Islam are Sharia interpreters. Islam's entire existence supervenes on the ruling of the Ummah, whereas Christianity can exist in Christian countries or in pagan countries.

Many moderate and so called ""modern Muslims"" would no doubt be offended by what I'm saying, and assert that I am touching on only the extreme points of the faith and that most Muslims don't practice these things. To them I would say unapologetically, you are bad Muslims. Let me unpack that statement. I do not mean to say they are bad people, and in fact I find their modernism and willingness to compromise refreshing. However, they are ""bad"" Muslims in the sense that they are not following a path that their faith is explicitly calling them down. Most modern Muslims are humanists, and their faith is more of an inherited cultural identity than anything else.

Back to extremism. There are many modern nations where Islam exists in the minority, such as the USA and Europe, and it is relatively tolerated. I do not know an example of a Islamic majority country where minority religions exist without a noticeable and tangible degree of persecution.

"To clarify, I am not against easier routes to citizenship--in fact, I'm all for it. I think if a person has toiled in this country long enough, paid their taxes, haven't committed any heinous crimes, etc etc, they are entitled to be able to apply for citizenship and not have it take 10-20 years to achieve. 



I am, however, against the idea that literally anyone who can buy a plane ticket or boat ride to the states can pop out a baby, have it be a US citizen, and promptly return to their home country a week or two after the fact. How does a baby who spent all of what, a week?, on US soil have a higher right to citizenship than anyone else--especially when the process takes so long for honest working people who likely contributed much more to this country? 


News sites claim that up to 60,000 Chinese nationals alone give birth in the US and promptly return back--there are even specialized birth hotels specifically for birth tourism. 



I feel that a person should be entitled to US citizenship only if they have actually contributed to the well-being of this country. Some foreign offspring who spent the blink of an eye here, whose parents have never ever paid US taxes or contributed in any way to this country, should not have automatic citizenship. 




If an illegal immigrant gave birth and stayed in this country (which many do), that would be a whole separate issue entirely. But to separate birth tourism from cases like that, one could enforce laws regarding duration of days in the US to ensure citizenship. 



My views are NOT against illegal immigrants, or people who have actually worked on this land and paid taxes and done something for this country. I am against people who squeeze out a baby and promptly return, doing NOTHING for the states except to take advantage of their child's citizenship later on. I bring this up because I'm teaching abroad in Asia, and a local friend mentioned how his friends are popping out offspring in the states. I find this incredibly immoral, and think it does nothing but hinder the citizenship process for people who have actually lived, worked, toiled, in the country and are American in every other way except citizenship.

"Recently I have seen a lot of posts regarding the topic of transgender and transphobia. This post is based upon a statement that I have read over and over again. ""If you were attracted to someone, learned they were trans, and then lost sexual interest in them, then you're transphobic.""
Example
(If pointing to someone else's comment isn't okay with the mods then let me know and I'll edit this out)

My argument revolves around the definition of Homophobia and comparing that to Transphobia.
A quick google will result in having them both defined as... Homophobia / Transphobia is the irrational fear of, aversion to, intense dislike of ,or prejudice against gay or transsexual or transgender people

I do not go out of my way to avoid gay people, I am perfectly fine with having a gay friend, and I don't look down on someone for being gay. By the above definition I am not homophobic. Assuming I follow all of the same rules, but for transgender or transsexual people, then I'm not transphobic.

The counter argument seems to be that if I am no longer attracted to someone after I learn that they are trans, then I am somehow discriminating or I have an aversion to them. But I would say that going by that definition I would also be homophobic.

As a straight male, I'm not attracted to other men. If we assume that I would enjoy anal with a woman, but not a man, then it could be said that I am discriminating against gay men or that I have an aversion to them. That's simply not true though. My body is programmed to want to be with a woman, so my sexual preference clearly isn't what determines if I'm homophobic. It's how I act around gay people that determines if I am homophobic.

 Just because I would avoid having sex with someone who is currently a man, and was previously a man turns me off, doesn't mean I have shaky morals. It simply means I have been programmed to be that way. Just because I don't like the taste of avocados doesn't mean I'm avophobic.

In the same sense, if I were to be turned off by learning that someone I would have had sex with a is currently a female, but formerly a man, it isn't due to me discriminating against them, its due to a biological mechanism trying to get me to have offspring. Again in this situation, my sexual preference is not a question of morals.

In conclusion since I am not homophobic and I act the same around gays and trans, then I am not Transphobic.

"Note: This is going to be kinda long because I'm kinda angry and I think this is a good idea, but I'd like to understand the counter arguments. 

Background: In the wake of the Charleston shooting many people on Reddit, and in the real world, have pointed out that we're poised to go through the same four step routine we've all become way too used to after events like this.

1. Fight about gun control

2. Discuss the amorphous ""mental health"" problem without any specifics

3. Bicker about something other than the actual problem. For instance, religious persecution instead of racial prejudice.

4. Get bored and forget about it.

Many people have been outraged over the fact that despite such comically obvious evidence that this was a racially motivated act, we're not going to do anything about the growing race problem in the U.S...again. Even going so far as not lowering the Confederate Flag outside the South Carolina Capitol building because that flag inexplicably requires a 2/3rds vote to lower. That has in turn raised, or re-raised the issue of stubborn insistence on using antebellum symbols and homages all throughout the South, which many people have pointed out as indicative of the pervasive racial biases throughout the country. 

The Idea: A federal law banning flying the Flag of the Confederation outside any public or municipal building, as well as a phasing out of all names associated with the Confederation from public roadways, buildings, etc. 

The Rationale: There are so many reasons, but I'll try to keep it succinct and duck most of the moral policing. First, It is tremendously offensive to black citizens, which, is fairly self-explanatory, and frankly should be to white citizens as well. Setting aside the racial implications, which we shouldn't, the Confederate Flag is a symbol of treason. Not only that, we are the only developed nation that not only displays, but does so with pride, symbols of our darker past. South African government buildings do not fly the Rhodesian flag, nor do the Japanese fly the Imperial flag. Germans have damn near made the Nazi flag a punishable offense.  How can the U.S. maintain any sort of moral high ground when we're rubbing slavery in the faces of ~15% of Americans? 

On the more implicit side, this is a very late, but very necessary, line in the sand against the more insidiously underground racial biases we still have. We're not going to tolerate this any more. The atmosphere that allowed Dylann Roof to foster and nurture his beliefs. No, not all beliefs are acceptable anymore, and you're going to have to stand out in the open if you hold these destructive beliefs. The government cannot continue a tacit tolerance of such a simple and easily solved FIRST step to mending race relations. It starts here, at the Flag, and we're actually going to stat working on our race issues.

So that's my stance. CMV

"EDIT: The Swastika and the CSA are completely different historically. Yes they both have done some horrible things and I am not in any way claiming they are justified for doing them. BUT HISTORICALLY any movement away from an established institution (slavery was around in the US for 100 plus years) is going to cause a rift. The South was wrong and they lost (thankfully). The Nazis on the other hand brought genocide into their country and amplified ethnic/racial tensions, this wasn't a case of people resisting an institution that has been in place for a hundred plus year. One factions is a group of people resisting change for good causes, the other promoting change for bad causes. 

ALSO.... looking at it from this perspective in no way condones slavery. I am simply giving a historical context for both situations. Just because it existed for 100 years prior to the civil war doesn't make it alright, it does however give you a frame of mind for some of these soldiers. Mix that with the fact they thought they were not being represented in the Federal Government, and yea they were a little ticked off. So please do not stoop so low as to call me a person who condones that...


Original Post:


I find it very annoying that in light of recent events this subject has gained traction. At the South Carolina capitol, a confederate flag flies and now that the shooting has happened, people are calling for it to be taken down. Not sure why people believe this is the cause of the shootings, the guy was a racist and a nut case. This flag flying had little to nothing to do with creating a culture of southern racism. 

To set a few things straight:
1. The flag cannot be taken down to half mast as it is a fixed flag (there is no string to pull it down, it simply sits on top of the poll.)
2. The flag is attached to a Civil War Memorial, fitting in my opinion. It is not attached to the capitol, it is on the grounds of the capitol. 

Beyond this my argument is that the flag is a part of US history and specifically, Southern US history (and since South Carolina was the first to secede... it has a highly unique history there). Yes, the flag does hold some racist connotations because it was essentially hijacked by the KKK and Neo-Nazis. This does not change the fact that it was a battle flag that Americans fought over in one of the most devastating wars in US history. 

I understand there were confederate national flags and the one we see flown today is a battle flag. I still find it acceptable for those in the south to fly the flag as a reminder of Southern culture/pride and a memorial to those lost during the war. 

If those who argue the flag represents those who wanted keep slavery I have two counter points. 1. The American flag represented those people for a much longer duration of time than the confederate flag, it is a dark part of our history and should never be forgotten. 2. It is estimated that 25%-33% of soldiers owned slaves, others fought because of vicious actions taken by the North and others to defend their homes (look up Sherman and Georgia).

Furthermore lets not forget this war wasn't slave holders v.s. abolitionists. The war was certainly about slavery but it wasn't as black and white as some people suggest. The South was fighting to keep slavery as a state right separate from federal law, the North was fighting because they didn't want their country being split in half. 

Lastly, flags are symbols that can be interpreted in multiple ways. There are those that see the American flag as a imperialistic, evil symbol. There are those that see the confederate flag as a stark reminder of our nation's dark history and cultural heritage. Just because a few people have championed it as their symbol for their hatred does not mean everyone who flies it agrees with this point of view. Furthermore, just because people find the flag offensive does not mean the flying of the flag was there to offend. 

TL;DR The flag flying in South Carolina has historic meaning and is attached to a memorial. It is not intended to offend or to represent racism. It is justified historically and by the first amendment to fly at the capitol.

"First, let me clarify by saying I don't support actual, intentional bashing of any kind, however:

We see jokes about it (especially on Reddit) all the time: political correctness is reaching a ludicrous level in our everyday society. It is getting to the point where you can't even make jokes or off-hand remarks without being considered rude, distasteful, ignorant, what ever. I think this is not only not really helpful to a person or group of persons who are facing adversity, it is detrimental. It causes issues that could be making actual progress to falter and nit-pick all of the tiniest little problems they can find rather than strive for real change. It is inadvertently focussing on the negativity in society rather than trying to find a positive solution. 

It is my opinion that the only way to get past adversity in life is to toughen up and become immune to it and push your way through it. Real change comes about because of real actions. 

This post was inspired by the earlier discussion on the use of the word ""cisgendered"" and wether it is ""normal"" or wether we should then be differentiating the difference between diabetics and nondiabetics and so forth. I don't think this is a helpful debate overall. sure, if you are asking what gender someone is, it is okay, even good, to distinguish, but all I keep seeing around here, and in real life, and at an increasing rate, is how we all need to check our privilege and be more and more sympathetic; how white people can't relate to minority problems, men can't relate to women's suffrage, cisgendered people can't really understand what transgendered people go through.. it just keeps getting more and more specific, and in my opinion, its just focussing everyone's attention on what is wrong with the world, and doesn't actually help us make it better.

Adversity is everywhere, it hits everyone.  I may be a man, but maybe my dad sexually abused me and locked me in the basement my whole childhood. That girl may be white, but maybe she was raised in a seedy part of town with a drug addicted prostitute mother. Maybe that guy is a straight white male from a nice neighborhood, but he was somehow infected with HIV and now he has AIDS. My point is, none of those people are going to get through their hardships by focussing on those things they can't change, doing so would only hinder their own growth. I can't help but think the same thing when I hear about someone getting upset about someone else using language they find to be offensive. Again, I'm not saying bullying is okay, but the line between what is considered okay to joke about, and what is borderline a hate crime seems to be getting thinner and thinner. In my eyes, trying to further political correctness is only babying everyone and hindering actual growth.

TL;DR There is no relative degree of suffering, everyone has a hard life, and trying to force everyone to walk on eggshells all the time doesn't help anyone make their life better.

I hope you don't think i'm terrible for thinking this way, and I would love to hear everyone's input.

"Every time I read the news or social media, and especially the comments tied to said news or social media, I end up with this cognitive dissonance.

On one hand: I understand and accept the privileges set forth to me, as a US American white male, that many members of minority groups do not have available to them. Even things as simple as watching movies and realized I'm seeing an exponentially larger number of white males than any other group, can remind me that there are things in my life that I take for granted which do not exist, or at least are there to a much smaller degree, in the lives of others. I find this unacceptable; I despise the idea that people are born into set roles or classes due to things outside of their control. No one asks to be born into poverty, or born to be viewed as suspicious just because they take part in activities others can do without question or second looks. 

On the other hand: Every day that I open the news, I find a new article that implies that I am some kind of horrible, racist, monster based only on my gender or the color of my skin. Sites like Salon, Motherjones, and Huffington Post drop hundreds of articles each month about white people AS A GENERALIZED GROUP, as if we're all some sort of problem people, individually. Even college professors like Saida Grundy seem to have no problem saying this... and their Universities have no problem allowing it. Which is part of what bothers me the most... it's not that clickbait articles exist, but rather that NO ONE CARES. 

EDIT: Edited the example to show a better case for point. Previous link was to the works of Arthur Chu. This is more inclusive
Example:  Take this selection of posts: http://www.salon.com/topic/whats_the_matter_with_white_people/ On this list, replace the word ""White"" with ""Black"" in your head. Look at how horrendously racist that list now comes out to be. And yet, because it says ""White"", it's cool. All is well in the world. Articles that start with ""Kanye West vs. white mediocrity: "" are currently in style.

Well, the problem is that it takes people like me, who WANT to be an ally and WANT to stand up and add another voice to the fray, shouting that things should be better for people who are not white... and it makes me want to remain silent. What could compel me to self loathe to the point of standing beside racists who despise me for the color of my skin, who disparage me for nothing that I did but rather the actions of people unrelated to me that I have never met and only share the single point of connection in the melonin content of our skin? 

What's the point of trying, if I'm a monster because of how I look and the only way I can ""correct"" that is to disparage myself because of the actions of others? Even just making a post like this, pointing out how digustingly bigotted and racist these views are, will make ME out to be the racist for bringing it up.

I truly do not understand the current path we are taking in race relations. I do not understand how this is supposed to help. I see so many people saying that we need to tackle racism head on, and that we need to talk about the problems... this is me doing that. Even if I get called a racist or a bigot for it, that's ok. I'm talking about the problem, and it IS a problem.

Why good does alienating allies really accomplish?

EDIT: Deltas have been awarded. Excellent points were made, and I while I still feel some injustice in certain situations on this topic, I do not feel that it is quite the widespread issue I viewed it as when I began. I still feel that the media is causing undue defensiveness with their ""click-bait"" article titles... but otherwise I feel better about the situation.

EDIT -  My first gold! Thanks :)

"     On the 18th of June, Dylann Roof walked into a church consisting of mostly black members alone and shot nine members alone. His motivations were to ignite an war that he likely believes is already starting. Before he walked into that church he posted a juvenile series of rants and pictures that gave glimpses into his obviously sick head to tell the world of his idiotic, racist views and manifest what he intended. He did all of this as to my knowledge, alone.
     After he committed his crime he was arrested, and everyone hated him. Although, no one of note is praising of him, obviously, there are people who claim that this is a symptom of a larger issue about race and oppression. The person I find most notable in this discussion is Jon Stewart: http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/kb2h42/charleston-church-shooting
    The argument that he is making has merit, Jon Stewart is a highly intelligent and empathetic human being who knows what he is talking about. But the demographic that Dylann Roof crawled away from to represent is an old and dying minority, that I truly believe. Yes, there are race problems and there are people of extreme disturbances that are willing to go to murderous lengths to make a statement about race, but no one with a sensible head on their shoulders believes such things. We should keep the discussion of race alive, and there are lengths that we as a society need to cover to reach the mountain top of racial equality, but why must we blame Charleston and the media as a whole for this one poor young man who had a clear mental health issue, and easy access to firearms? Is it hard for us to turn our minds to the more obvious debate that needs to be made about gun control and mental health treatment? 
     It is an argument that has been made and beaten to death before, and feels a little more ignored this time around. If Dylann Roof had more red tape and more red flags put in his way, maybe this tragedy could have been deterred or at least mitigated. At least, that's one thing in this situation we could have controlled. We could not make race relations better in a few months, nor could we prevent Dylann Roof from changing his mind as easily as one Saturday morning cartoon, but we could have made his actions much harder to go about.
     There are race relations to address in this country, and that will be healed with more time, but we aren't helping ourselves by making this act more than a symptom of the case. Race relations didn't make Dylann Roof a murderer, his own rage and fractured mental health did, and the glock was far too easy for him to reach. 
I am not trying to disparage the obvious issues between white people, black people, and any other race, but I am not understanding why it is paramount we make this about race, rather than the argument that we have based most other mass-shootings on. So please, CMV.

"It's been awhile since I've seen the movie, but one line has stuck with me for years: ""If everyone's super, no one will be."" This basically sums up the ideology of the villain of the film: Syndrome is trying to build inventions that would give any user superpower-level abilities, so that ""natural"" superheroes wouldn't be special anymore.

Now, Syndrome is a villain, regardless of his beliefs. He kidnaps the Incredibles and tries to kill at least some of them. He also built a death robot to destroy an entire city (for reasons that I still do not understand). The movie correctly portrays these behaviors as villainous. However, for no apparent reason, Syndrome is acting on a surprisingly positive, egalitarian motive. If they wanted to make a compelling villain, he could have had a simple world domination goal, or just wanted to make himself a superhero. But no: Syndrome's goals are to make ""natural"" superheroes no better than anyone else...by making everyone a superhero. And this is bad, because....?

The theme gets even weirder at the end, where Dash pretends to be less than stellar at track and gets second place, despite his powers. Apparently, the Incredibles are fine with the appearance of equality, as long as they know they're really superior. In fact, it's nice to let other people PRETEND to be the best, and you don't have to feel threatened by that, because you'll always be the real best. I can't help but view the film as a struggle between two profoundly incorrect viewpoints. I walk away knowing that Syndrome did more evil things, but hating the Incredibles more because they're just so unlikeable.

Syndrome is correctly cast as the villain of the piece because of his bullying of the Incredibles and city destructobot, but his plan to provide cool gadgets for everyone is not evil, and it would not be a bad thing if ""everyone was super."" On the contrary, it would be the best outcome of the movie. We only get a brief glimpse of Syndrome's inventions, but even the few we see appear to have some potential livesaving applications (flying shoes for firefighters to get people out of burning buildings; laser glasses to rescue people trapped in car accidents). If everyone was super, it wouldn't just be a lucky few tasked with saving people whether they wanted to or not. Instead, those who truly wanted to could do it, and as many people as necessary could have each ""power."" If we had the technology to do so, we ought to make everyone super. Syndrome's alleged motive for evil falls totally flat, and the Incredibles' reaction is weirdly elitist. CMV.

Edit: My V has been partially C'd. Thanks to u/FlyingMiracle for first pointing out that I misconstrued Syndrome's real goal. His stated plan was to sell his gadgets to the highest bidder, not give them to well-trained service professionals to save lives. He did SAY ""if everyone is super, no one will be"" in a threatening tone of voice, and I still think equality is a dumb motive for a villain. But it doesn't seem to BE his motive at all. He's just going to make the rich and powerful more rich and powerful, and probably destroy the world when tons of rich, inexperienced people fuck shit up with his devices. He claims to be working for equality, but even if he went about his plan without trying to kill the Incredibles or unleash his deathbot, he would still be wreaking havoc, not promoting equality.","{'his', 'himself', 'he', 'villain'}"
"I love transgendered people, and I find this new (to me) topic interesting.

But I don't think that normally gendered people need to use the term cisgender, or even know what it is. I also don't think it's wrong to refer to a cisgendered person as ""normal,"" (edit: regarding their gender identity and not them as a whole person) rather than cisgendered. 

If the trans community want to have terms like this, which I obviously see the utility of, then great, call me that all you want.

I just don't understand why suddenly I am not a normal male, and why it's offensive to refer to myself as a normal &lt;gender. I don't see why certain transsexual individuals have attacked me for simply refering to cisgender as normal, instead of this ""designated male at birth"" terminology I had never heard of before venturing over to /r/trans. 

I would compare this to anyone with an uncommon trait getting vocally offended by not being refered to by a specific terminology they feel more comfortable with. If autistic children, diabetics, people with parkinson's and paraplegics all wanted to be called something new, it would get incredibly confusing to talk to people without offending anyone.

I completely understand that transsexuals have a hard life, huge suicide rate, etc., but I don't think that babying them by tiptoeing around words like ""normal"" when they simply are not normally gendered humans is the right approach. I don't believe masking or avoiding reality is ever a good thing, and we can easily push for equal rights and respect for all transsexuals, even if people reserve the word normal when it comes to gender for someone who is cisgendered.

"Hello there. 

I am a guy from Bangladesh, a highly conservative Islamic country. English is not my native language. I will still try to explain the issue to the best of my ability. If you do not understand something, do ask for clarifications. Furthermore, I do not intend to offend anyone, so please don't take it otherwise. 

I should also say that I am very irreligious, and I am just a Muslim officially. Other than that my views fall in the camp of Liberal Agnosticism. In other words I tend to support contemporary Western social values on morality to some extent. 

Anyways the thing is, I believe that most devoutly religious people are on on the whole good people. If you take a weighing scale and place their good and bad deeds, the scale of righteousness will be many times more heavier than the scale of evil. This would be mostly true for followers of any religion. If someone has lead all their life strictly adhering to their religion, it is highly likely that these people are on the whole many times moral than the average Westerner or the Common people of the world 

Since they are many times more moral than the common people of the world, especially the West, these people should be held in high esteem. Even if we don't agree with their views, we should still accept that they are a better person than us and we should aspire to follow in their moral path, even if we do not follow their religious path. We should also place them on a pedestal or have a very high esteem for them and make them leaders among our people. 

I have seen a lot of hatred and mockery towards this group by most Westerners, especially Reddit. People here are always saying ""Dont Preach here, you "" and things along those lines. People seem to consider themselves on par or atleast better than devoutly religious people even if they are themselves sleeping around.  

Sure you could argue that there are examples of religious people being criminals, but that is in the minority. This ofcourse does not mean, that their actions against other human beings would be ignored. It would be left to the victim to either forgive or enforce the justice that he owes.

"I don't even know where to start. 



I am generally a happy and healthy person. I was raised Catholic. I am not a strict Catholic. I enjoy the community of church. I don't take everything at face value or for fact. About 8 years ago I came to terms that there is probably no Heaven. Death is just ceasing to exist. I was okay with that. I still felt we had souls or spirits. I still hoped for or had affection for the possibility of a God, even though it probably didn't exist. I still hoped for an afterlife of some sort, even though I didn't know what it would manifest as and that the chance of one was actually quite slim. I felt my children were a blessing. Their births were the most beautiful, tender days of my life. I took joy and pride in everything my kids did. Some days I would just well up with pride and happiness, so happy that our lives have been rich and lucky. Any thoughts of death or mortality were far, far from my mind. I just didn't think about those types of things. Sure, the thoughts flitted through my mind every now and then and I would think about them. I would discuss it with my spouse. Usually I would take comfort in the intense love and happiness we have and know that no matter what happens at the end, somehow we would still go on, whether it be in the hearts or memories of others, in some type of spirit/soul that survived death, in photos or videos . . . The jury was out on what happens, but I was at least accepting or positive about it. 




Now, I feel like a shattered, empty person.




As I've gotten older, I have developed high blood pressure (family history). My doctor put me on Atenolol 50mg once a day. About four days in, I started to feel sad and question my mortality and my family's mortality out of nowhere. Things just spiraled out of control after that. I learned about nihilism, atheism, existentialism, what happens after death, that we are just computers, emotions aren't real, just by-products of brain impulses ... just lots of things I never thought about before and I became incredibly depressed. Crying everyday, scared of the eventuality of our lives, the meaningless of life, the possible lack of a soul, no proof of an afterlife ... I feel like I've been down a horribly dark rabbit hole and I want to get out.




I went back to my doctor and he said Atenolol, being a beta blocker, can cause depression, so he took me off of it. I was on it for two weeks. My last dose was about 96 hours ago. I'm not feeling much better. How long does it take the medication to get out of my system and for all my brain chemistry to start working again? I'm having a lot of trouble finding meaning in what I do, and what I do with my family since there's no point. We won't remember anything after we die. Why do I care if I get some award at work? What do I care if my kid gets in the school play? Why celebrate someone's birthday? I feel empty. I feel hollow. I do not want to feel like this.
Could this really all be a cause of the medicine? Or did I do this to myself? Will my feelings of happiness and excitement come back? Will I find meaning again? How long until I could be ""back to normal?"" 




This current depressive state is so unlike me and nothing I have ever experienced before. I'm scared I'll always have these depressing thoughts about mortality and life's meaning that I just don't want in my head anymore. I want to rewind the last two weeks and go back to my jovial, excited, proud self that I was. I want to believe in what I used to believe in. I feel like now that I've researched what really happens after death, or researched that we probably have no souls, that we are just a product of brain chemistry, that I can never go back to how I was. I WANT to, though. I feel like now that I've gotten a peek at what we really are (sophisticated computers) that I can never be happy again. I don't want to know these truths. I want to go back to how I was. I am losing meaning in anything I do.  I am becoming detatched from my children and spouse. I don't enjoy doing anything with them. It's all just a reminder that they will die someday, too. I don't want to live in a world where they don't exist, but that's where I am destined to be and it destroys me. I can't look at my kids and be happy anymore, knowing that anything we do is meaningless. Yes, I know there are the arguments that YOU have to provide meaning and make something out of the life you are given, but that doesn't help me feel better at all. It makes me feel worse. I feel like I have to work now to assign or find meaning, rather than it just naturally occurring and flowing and being part of my day-to-day life. My kid drew a picture today and happily showed me. All I could muster was a ""nice job,"" instead of my usual effortless pride and happiness in how he was developing and growing.  




Each time I try to make myself feel better, I ruin it.  I tell myself that it is possible all humans, animals have souls. I know there is no scientific proof right now (except for the Lanza theories which I am not sold on), but I feel it's possible for everyone to just have that essential spark in them. Then I feel better, but then realize that our consciousness is just our brains tricking us into thinking we are an ""I"" or we are a ""self."" That it's impossible for a soul to exist. Where in evolution would we even have developed one? What happened to all the beings in death who didn't have souls? Or were souls present in the primordial ooze we came from? See, that's just not realistic.  I look up stuff online which just confirms this bleakness. There's no hope anymore. Pre-Atenolol me wouldn't have thought these thoughts. Now I'm destroyed by them. Now I'm just thinking that every memory I make, every experience I have is for nothing. 




I just want to go back to my happy, silly, proud self. Is this all just the medicine? I want to take pride in my family again. I want the little things to become important again. I want to be carefree and hopeful again. However, I feel now that I've gotten a glimpse of the dark and painful truths of our existence that I'm going to never be able to get over this crisis, never get these thoughts out of my head, and never be happy again for the rest of my life. This terrifies me. I just want to be who I was again, but it think that's impossible. 




Please, please change my view.

"Governors execute the laws that their legislatures pass, they respond to disasters, they act as a backstop to the judicial system if someone is harshly punished through pardoning people, they guide economic policy, they are chief cheerleader for their state. Basically, they have plenty to do, and plenty of places to show folks that they are leading through doing leadership things in a very leady way.
They shouldn't be inserting their opinion  into a system that has police, district attorneys, prosecutors, and judges who all have their own roles to play.

"Massive spoilers below.

I just finished the book version of The Martian, which has Mark Watney, a NASA astronaut, stranded on Mars when the rest of his crew leaves, thinking him dead.

Watney is not dead though, and has to survive on Mars via his wits alone til he can make some contact with Earth (his crewmates having taken all but one radio, and the one they didn't take having stabbed him before flying off.

In the book.  Watney establishes contact with NASA by driving over to the Sojurner rover and stealing/fixing it to transmit to Earth (which...awesome).

A few plans are developed to save him, one involving a hastily built probe to resupply him which blows up on takeoff.  That first one I buy.  But the latter plans I don't.  And I have two principal objections.

First, it seems like NASA executives make the calls on these.  This would not be the case.  It would be the President of the United States making the ultimate decision to greenlight projects.  And at that level, it seems very unlikely that they'd get the greenlight.  The independence of NASA in the book is greatly at odds with how I see government agencies working.

The Chinese government would not give a large booster over to NASA like they did.  This is portrayed as happening at the agency level coordinating with the Chinese space agency and then presenting it to political leaders as a fait accompli.

The plan is super-risky though, and depends on a single resupply mission with a quickly built supply ship - one of which just blew up on the pad.  If the resupply doesn't work, all 6 astronauts die.  Or 5, if they do space cannibalism.

I just don't think the governments of two countries who don't get along great would coordinate to waste hundreds of millions to billions of dollars (the plan also scrubs Ares 4 by taking its ascent vehicle), all to have a very low chance of rescuing one guy at the substantial risk to 5 more people.  And the Hermes mutiny to force the government's hand just seems absurdly implausible to me.

Much more likely is that Watney would have been asked to compose letters to whomever he wanted, perform science til his food ran out (assuming he was willing) and then take a lethal dose of morphine.

"First, I'd like to point out that I'm well aware of the history of blackface, and the older utilization of it to offensively portray some awful stereotype of black people is racist. However, I don't think that has any bearing on blackface today. What if an actor of another race simply wanted to portray a black character, and so they darkened the color of their skin to make their appearance more accurate? There could be absolutely no mocking of race going on, and people will still shout ""racism!""

For example, I know a white girl who tried to do an impression of Michelle Obama. She dressed up in blackface and made jokes about healthy eating and vegetables and whatnot. She got torn apart on social media for being racist. Although I can see how this impression is in bad taste, I cannot see how it is racist. She only made fun of Michelle Obama's campaigning, and she never once made fun of her race at all. And yet, it was still considered racist.",{'actor'}
"Let me preface this by saying I own Goldeneye 007 and have played it in both single and multiplayer. Neither particularly impressed me. Note that I don't blame Goldeneye's developers for this; they did the best they could with what they had at the time, and if you compare it to Duke Nukem 64 or SNES Doom it beats them by a landslide. 

Goldeneye was absolutely revolutionary for its time, and shaped the path of future FPS games. However, by today's standards, it is absolutely awful and is outclassed in literally every way by today's games.  This is for a number of reasons, including mechanics, controls, and map variety. Despite this, many people choose to play Goldeneye, even though it is crap. 

It's not even moderately close-ish who wins between, say, Battlefield 4 or Goldeneye. However, since I know you guys are going to point out the massive price disparity between buying a PS3/X360 with 4 controllers and an N64 with 4 controllers, I'm going to instead compare it with Timesplitters 2 on the PS2, which I believe to hold up far better today. A PS2 with 4 controllers and TS2 costs you $50 + $10x4 + $10 = $100. (Amazon prices) An N64 with 4 controllers and Goldeneye costs you $50 + $20x4 + $15 = $145. (Amazon prices) All of this is used.

Let's first compare game mechanics. It makes sense that Goldeneye's game mechanics are less complex than Timesplitters 2's because the controller has fewer buttons. In Goldeneye you have the ability to do the following: aim, move, zoom in, fire, perform contextual actions, and switch weapons in one direction. Timesplitters 2 offers all of that as well as the ability to crouch and reload, as well as cycle backward and forward through your weapons. Of course, both of these games' mechanical complexities pale in comparison to today's FPS games, which add sprinting, jumping, and more.

Next, controls. The N64's lack of dual analog makes the clear winner TS2. Other than that, they pretty much have the same control scheme. Props to Goldeneye for having more variety, but most of the variety is exceptionally poorly thought out schemes where moving and aiming are mixed between the C buttons and the analog stick.

Finally, there is map variety. Due to the limitations of the N64, all of Goldeneye's maps are basically the same: completely indoor mazes of hallways and doors. Granted, there is much more variety than on most games of this type in that era, but compare this to TS2. You can CREATE YOUR OWN MAPS and many of the pre-created maps are outdoors. The maps also feel very different: the difference between Caves and Library is nothing compared to between Circus and Hangar, for instance.

All these points are why I feel that Goldeneye 007 is a relic of the past and if you're looking for a multiplayer FPS experience you are better off looking elsewhere. In fact, other than ""because I played it as a kid,"" or ""because I own no consoles newer than the N64,"" I don't think there is any reason at all to play Goldeneye. CMV!

"So if you haven't heard already, there was a recent shooting in a Charleston church.(https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3a8k4r/breaking_active_shooting_downtown_charleston/) Many reports are coming out with evidence that points it as a racially motivated hate crime. (I'm not here to argue whether or not it was, as the investigation is still ongoing and many developments have yet to come, but for the purpose of this discussion I'm going to assume it was.)  

Much like with the Elliot Rodgers case, there are many people already stating that this is purely a mental health issue and it's just the liberal media drumming up a race war and etc.  

I don't think it's fair to detract from those arguments, as there are many many people with mental illnesses living non-violently. Even if people with certain mental illnesses have a higher chance of committing violence, and even if most mass murderers do have some kind of mental illness, it shouldn't detract from the fact that there are social motivators that led them ultimately to taking others' lives. The reason I say it's ""disingenuous"" to downplay them is because it allows people who believe there's nothing wrong (eg. that racism is still a major problem) to persuade others that there's nothing wrong, even though there's evidence in the form of the killings that there's still a problem. 

In this case, it was the suspect's surrounding himself with racist rhetoric that led him so far down a path of hatred towards black people that he acted violently against them. In Elliot Rodger's case, it was his intense hatred of women not sleeping with him (and resentment of other men he saw as his 'competitors') that ultimately led him to go on his spree.  

I believe that bigoted hatred should also be addressed alongside mental illness, and shouldn't be downplayed by the media or the public whenever these issues arise. Especially since not all killers are mentally ill, and so addressing these motivators will still help reduce violence.","{'he', 'his', 'men', 'him', 'himself'}"
"I have lived in Boston for nearly five years and am currently searching for my 3rd apartment in the area (my moves have been because of either price or commute). I have a small dog (12 pounds, 5 years old) and my probable roommate also has a dog (70 pounds, 10 years old). During each move, I have had trouble finding a landlord who will accept dogs, and finding one that accepts two feels nearly impossible. 

I have always received full pet deposits back and have reference letters from previous landlords, but this does not seem to factor into their policies. The most common reasons they bring up are noise, yard waste, and possible damage to apartment (mainly floors and walls). Having lived next to families with young children and beneath freshly minted college graduates, I cannot understand the bias against dogs.

Yes, my dog barks when the doorbell rings or there is noise in the stairwell, but she calms down after a couple minutes and has been trained so I can get her to sit and quiet almost immediately when I'm home. On the other hand, the baby I lived by would cry loud enough to be heard in my apartment and was often difficult to calm down. The young guys upstairs often play music loud enough to be heard in other apartments (even outside the building) and we had a lengthy struggle with our property manager to get their behavior under control. Why should dogs be singled out as being a noise issue?

And yes, my dog's nails have made some scratches on the floor and in the paint. Children often play with toys that can and do cause the exact same damage. The stairwell in my current building is all scratched up from neighbors moving furniture (and the entryway light was broken during one move) and the guys upstairs constantly drop beer cans (by their own admission) and have weights they shift across the floor almost daily. Again: why single dogs out as problematic? And isn't this exactly what the security deposit is intended to cover?

Regarding the yard, which I suppose is dog specific: I have a scoop and clean up after my dog every time. This is exactly the kind of information contained in the references from my previous landlords. If considered on a case by case basis, I see no reason this ""issue"" isn't avoidable.

In short: why is it okay to single dogs out as potential problems and usable as an excuse to refuse tenancy? I understand that the laws allow them to do so whereas they can't deny an application based on age or having children; I disagree with this as well. Either landlords can discriminate for any reason that may cause sound or damage, OR they must allow them all (including dogs). I hesitate to use a loaded word like ""discrimination"", but it's hard to resist, especially seeing as people who choose to have children are protected but those who choose to have pets are heavily restricted.

FURTHERMORE, I believe changing their policy would actually benefit the landlords (especially early on). When so many apartments disallow pets, the ones they open their doors would have a wider pool of potential tenants. In many places (definitely in Boston), the rental market has numerous issues that need to be addressed and the landlords currently hold all the cards, so this benefit isn't immediately obvious. Still, I believe it would bear out in an overall more fair market.

PS - I would understand some policies relating to location and breed, such as not allowing dogs over 100 pounds in an apartment with less than 500 square feet or something, but that would be for the dog's safety. Restrictions on breeds for being ""too violent"" seem very problematic and I believe should be examined on a case-by-case basis.

TL;DR: Dogs are, on average, no worse than children or simply irresponsible/inconsiderate adults, so landlords should not be able to deny tenancy to pet owners.

Part of that paper was to write an opposing side, how someone of the opposite view could shut down my opinion. I had difficulty doing this myself, so I turned to my dad. He is completely against homosexuality. However, when I asked, he couldn't give a LEGITIMATE reason. All he said was ""it's gross"" and ""against the Bible."" Well, ""it's gross"" isn't necessarily a valid point I can include into a formal paper, and not everybody agrees with the Bible or religion, so I couldn't really use that either.

"I've drunk the koolaide. I'm becoming a biased partisan hack. I believe that one of the biggest problems with this country is the deep, seemingly irreconcilable animosity between the followers of the two parties, and I am part of that problem. 



Yet as much as I try, I cannot bring myself to view the Republicans as anything but a regressive influence on the USA. On some deep level, I've accepted the stereotype that Republican voters are bible thumping, gun wielding, blindly patriotic semi-racists. I'm not talking so much about the elected officials but rather the voters. I feel that, from what I can gather through the 'liberal' media and my personal experience, Republican opinions are largely formed (at least more so than Democrats) on ignorance, xenophobia, religion, guns, and hatred for Obama. I know such a broad and negative stereotype can't really be true, but I still can't shake it. I don't pretend to understand much about economics so most of my feelings come from my revulsion with the party's stance on social issues. 



Here are a few bits of my limited understanding of the party's platform:



Social Issues: 

- Opposing gay marriage: I have tried to find a credible argument against gay marriage, but have repeatedly failed. Currently, their argument before the supreme court rests on gays being unfit to raise children/procreate and the floodgates opening for polygamy etc.  

- Downplaying racial/gender discrimination as out of control political correctness: This seems like mostly suburban/rural white men being unable to empathize with groups of people they've never/rarely met. And some genuine racism.

- Defensiveness over religion/guns: The gun debate is too muddied for me to have a strong opinion on, but I feel Republicans' fears over attacks on Christianity are largely unfounded and that, if anything, Christianity has too large an influence on our culture/government.

- Immigration: I don't understand the positives/negatives of different approaches to immigration, but the Republican voter's opposition seems to come from xenophobia and trumped up fear about terrorists/freeloaders sneaking in.



Security Issues:

- Support for aggressive policing and invasive homeland security: I realize Rand and Co have been at the forefront of action against the NSA, but my personal experience has left me believing that most Republican voters are for strengthening national security and increasing military spending. I also feel that the strongest voices to come out in support of the recent police-on-black violence were conservatives.

- Hawkish foreign policy: I feel that Republicans have an emotional and aggressive reaction to Russia, Iran, Syria, ISIS and would be more willing to intervene militarily without regard to whether or not such intervention would be beneficial. They seem willing to pursue cathartic violence and disinclined to examined our militaries checkered past.



Economic Issues:

- Welfare Queens: Again, I really don't understand enough about economics to judge a good policy from a bad one, but I see the Republicans as using the idea of welfare queens to scare up opposition to social programs and further stigmatize the poor. They view Obamacare/Goverment assistance as handouts given to the undeserving.

- Blame the poor: It feels like Republicans push the idea that, without regulations, people will be able to pull themselves out of poverty and that the only thing keeping them down is either the government or their own laziness.



Environmental Issues:

- Global warming skepticism: This seems motivated by the party's ties to fossil fuel, fear of change, hatred for anything Obama, and anti-intellectual disdain for 'nancy-pansy' green stuff.





TL:DR - I feel like the Republican voting base is motivated primarily by religion, xenophobia, fear of change, hatred for Obama. Their positions are ignorant, contradict available evidence, short sighted, and selfish. 





What would change my mind?

-Evidence of a largely liberal leaning media/culture that suppresses honest Republican voices and prevents me from seeing the other side of the picture.

-Evidence that Republican news media (Fox, Breibart, Drudge, Talk Radio, etc) are reputable and not fear mongering propaganda barkers. 

-Strong arguments supporting the Republican platform and evidence that Republican voters share these views.

-Surprise me!

"Given the claim that transgender people should be able to choose whichever restroom or locker room they choose based on their own self-identification, it is illogical to say that I, as a man, should not be able to choose to go into a women's restroom or locker room. For simplicity, I will use just ""restroom"" going forward, but mean for these to be treated equally unless you have an argument that hinges on a distinction between a locker room and restroom.  

Let's leave aside the single-user restrooms, as we know that people of all types use the ""wrong"" room at times due to lines, messiness, out of order, etc., and no one thinks that's a big deal. 

Let's assume it is valid for a man to say he feels like a woman and that identity crisis / condition justifies his choice of restroom. If that is the case, surely it is not his wearing of women's apparel that conveys that right upon him. If that were so, any man could dress as a woman and that would earn him the right to use the restroom of his choice. The same argument would be made for any gender specific behavior (wearing of lipstick, shaving his beard, carrying a purse, etc). 

Further supporting the claim that it cannot be behavior is the idea that is a logical prerequisite for transgender to be an accepted idea: that gender is a social construct. If this is the case, a natural man can dress and act in ways that society expects of women and still fully identify as a man. 

Therefore, it is only the internal situation, the mental state, that makes the difference between whether he can go into the women's room or not. If that is the case, there can clearly be no independent rule for determining if he is ""serious enough"" about it to make it acceptable (and legal, depending on local laws) to stroll into a women's restroom. 

I can anticipate two substantial arguments:

1.  Most transgender people have brain chemistry / structure that corresponds to the opposite sex (sex dysphoria), so there is a biological link that is definite and verifiable. Rebuttal: This is not the case for all transgender people, so while some people may be ""certifiably"" qualified to use the other restroom, there isn't any bright line to tell us who isn't so qualified. Further, there are those who do not identify with either gender. Should those people be told that their gender identity doesn't matter and that they should have to use a particular restroom based on sex at birth? 

2. Transgender people have years of therapy and possibly surgery, and that is what gives them the right to choose to use the restroom of the opposite sex. Rebuttal: This would mean that any transgender person who hasn't sought therapy or surgery, for any reason, including cost, availability, etc., does not have that right. 

I am sure some will also focus on the safety issue, saying that it is safer for a transgendered person to use the restroom that corresponds to his/her identity. However, that does not in any way impact the argument that others should also be able to have a choice. 

Obliviously, some support unisex restrooms as a solution, but that is a technical solution, not a rebuttal to this argument. 

In short, I should be able to use whatever restroom or locker room that I want, without question, because no one has any way to verify or validate my gender identity. If it is not based on my genitals, there is no valid basis for telling me I must use the men's room.

Not conforming to gender roles doesn't mean that you have the choice to identify yourself as a different gender whenever you please.   
When a trans person switches, they have to jump through all sorts of hoops to legally be a gender. If we recognized ""gender fluidity"" all sorts of problems could arise, such as ""which change room should I use?"". Would it just change depending on how they were feeling that day? Would we all be okay with men, deciding that they are more of a woman today, going into female change rooms and stripping down in front of children?  
I don't believe that people really feel the need to change their genders on a daily basis, and I don't agree with those who would try to force me to respect their ""fluid"" gender. There is already a term for people who don't conform to gender stereotypes and it's androgyny. I consider myself to be a very open person, especially when it comes to other peoples personal choices that don't affect me so please CMV.  
EDIT: u/Paimon has changed my view about gender fluidity being a thing. It's a thing. I still disagree with most of you saying there are no legal or social ramifications though, especially about the change rooms, and on how to address someone who is gender fluid.    
EDIT 2: A lot of people are trying to change my view based on what they think the world should be like (i.e gender neutral bathrooms and change rooms) rather than being realistic about what it actually is (women have to be guarded in order to protect themselves from sexual harassment.) I still don't believe that men with biological man parts should be allowed to waltz into a women's change room because they are feeling like a woman that day, and that I should just trust that they know better than I do what their gender is when their dick is in my face.  
That being said I understand how they is a good term over he/she. It sounds weird to call a girl a they but if someone asked me to refer to them that way, obviously I would. ","{'men', 'man'}"
"In the last year or so I’ve seen at least three major comedians complain that the younger generations are politically correct to the point of stifling humor: Jerry Seinfeld, John Cleese, and Bill Maher. I think there are other people who were every bit as incorrect as those men but understood better what young people want from their comedy, and that indicates the problem is with the jokes, not the incorrectness.

In Jerry Seinfeld’s recent complaint, he used the example of comparing people’s use of cell phones to a gay French king . Maybe people hearing that joke would look particularly sour when he brought the homosexual stereotype into it, but I think that’s because there wasn’t really any humor there to justify it in the first place - talking about cell phone culture and people not seeming connected to each other is an incredibly stale topic, and I seriously doubt he would have gotten more of a laugh if he took the ‘gay’ part out of it.

John Cleese appeared on Bill Maher’s show (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCj6YNIpqmA) and complained that he could do jokes about some ethnicities/nationalities and not others - citing the example that he could say “Why are Australians so well-balanced? Because they have a chip on each shoulder” but couldn’t tell a Mexican joke. Again I think a lot of the issue there is that laughter at the Australian joke was already bordering on a sympathy laugh - it literally sounds more like something you’d get out of a joke book than what you’d expect from one of the lead members of Monty Python.

And Maher is one of the worst - on a weekly basis, he delivers a monologue at the start of his show and inevitably makes a politically incorrect joke and complains that the audience doesn’t laugh - but a lot of the rest of the monologue isn’t that enthralling either, it’s just that the audience is willing to be good sports as long as no one’s being shit on.

Meanwhile, there are other sources of comedy that I’ve never seen someone in my generation take issue with, despite them completely ignoring political correctness. George Carlin would have been nearly eighty this year, and made points about abortion, religion, family, and government that were incredibly politically incorrect - but no one complained about it, because his points were novel, clever, and generally punched upward. Same thing with Dave Chappelle - he’s in his forties, but his comedy is still fresh and hilarious to young people because he was saying things they hadn’t heard before and was clearly doing it out of love. Danny DeVito is over seventy, and appears on the show Always Sunny in Philedelphia, which is horribly ‘incorrect’ - they’ve made jokes regarding women, homosexuals, transexuals, Jews, Catholics, Muslims, the poor, the homeless, the mentally ill - and yet I’ve never seen anyone from my generation take the slightest offense because the material is handled with a genuinely warm and ludicrous humor. Other shows like Weeds, Workaholics, South Park, and almost anything Seth MacFarlane worked on (a little overdone now, but we laughed when his shows were new) couldn’t get through an episode without being wildly incorrect, yet it was rarely our generation that was taking issue with them.

So, if you feel the younger generation (say 30 and below) really has a problem seeing humor in the politically incorrect, now’s your chance to argue for that.

EDIT: A lot of people are describing this as a college-related issue. I only attended a semester of college and never got that involved in 'social justice' type conversations. Also, if it's specifically people being trained in how to think by the older generation who are taking offense, that's not really an argument the younger generation is the one with the problem. I'd say generally, with people I know, the only ways in which they seem less 'incorrect' than their parents are on genuine issues of racial and gender stereotypes.

EDIT 2: OK, George Carlin nodded along when other people complained of political correctness to him. Having one more or one less person complaining about the topic really doesn't change the brunt of my argument - that there are plenty of incorrect things most of my generation will laugh it, they're just different things than the previous generation.

FINAL EDIT: I'm starting to get arguments I've already responded to for the third of fourth time, so I'm going to head out for a while and if I see anyone really taking a different tack I'll respond to it when I come back.","{'he', 'men', 'king', 'his', 'he’s'}"
"Choosing a face for the dollar shouldn't be an act to satisfy any given group. Inevitably, a woman's face would've ended up on a dollar eventually, by more natural means, such as an open vote in which a woman won, and in my opinion, that was going to be coming very soon! But now, it's going to go down in history as an act of pandering, in an attempt to 'empower' women. 

Women are not a hive mind, so putting someone who owns a set of ovaries on currency, they are not all affected by it, or given strength by it. Women do not assimilate respect and admiration and add it to the collective, like the Borg.
 Yes, if we grew as a nation during a time that was not racist, sexist, and generally terrible towards so many people, a woman could've been president, and easily been on US currency long ago.
Yes, women have been oppressed throughout history, but that's not something that you can make up for by suddenly going out of your way to put a woman in the spotlight every so often. It shouldn't be such a monumental deal. 
To me, it's like approaching a black fellow and whilst shaking his hand, saying ""Hello good fellow, I am not racist, and I hardly even noticed that you are of a darker complexion. I am glad to make your acquaintance, fellow valuable person.""

"Yes, another thread about transgender people on CMV.Sorry, if this particular view was already expressed and I also don't mean to offend anyone. I am in full support of people living their lives as they please and transitioning if they please.I also believe that gender dysphoria is an innate trait related to hormones and genes like homosexuality/bisexuality.


I had a discussion with one of my long time friends which was born with female genitalia and who identifies as male. This person often gets angry when people refer to him as ""she"" or a ""girl""(this person looks female). To him, he is a male, a transgender male.

Now,my understanding is that a transgender individual is one who doesn't identify as the sex they were assigned at birth.(Ex: feeling like you are a woman when you possess a penis and testicles)

To my friend being a man/male would basically be defined as the following.Personally, I found his definition circular,hence flawed, as it seemed he was using the very term he was trying to define within the definition.Man: Person who identifies as a man.

The arguments generally used against my stance of defining it according to sex organs are the grey areas one may encounter doing so, for example intersexed people.However, I'd argue a circular definition is worse than one with grey areas as it outright doesn't tell us what we're trying to define.Other responses seem to be that we ought to define according to neurology/psychology of individuals being more masculine/feminine, hence not using the ""X: Person who identifies as X"". However, I feel that a psychological portrait ( and hence neurological portrait) is going to generate a greater amount of grey areas than a general physiological one.I also don't understand why we would reject an account based on physiological properties like sex organs/hormones, but then use the brain instead which is a much more complex and less accessible system and hence harder to use for classification.

Definitions are not objective facts ,they are subjective association that we make between terms and concepts for the sole purpose mainly to facilitate discussion and communication. There is no logical reason ""a plane figure with four equal straight sides and four right angles."" as to be the term ""square"" anymore then it has to be term ""carré"".

I personally agree with what somebody else said on the issue of definitions in general ""there are no good or bad definitions just useful ones"" which. A definition should be as clear as possible, we should favor definition which are less vague. A definition should not be circular as it doesn't really tell us anything, how could we understand the definition fully  when the whole reason we are looking at it is because we're unaware of the sense of one of it's components?

"To start, I'm not here to discuss wealth distribution, or income inequality. They are real issues that need to be addressed, and as much as governments like to talk about the middle class, they aren't doing much that actually helps them.

The inflation: Middle class families used to live in 2-4 bedroom 1-2 bath bungalows in the suburbs or small towns. Quite often siblings would share a bedroom, there would be fights over who got to shower first because there was only one shower and a finite amount of hot water. You packed a sandwich for lunch, dad drove the one car the family owned and would own for the next 10 years to work and mom walked or took transit if available. Clothing was handed down to younger siblings or cousins, there was one modestly sized TV in the house, and when families got a computer it was for the entire family to share. Vacations where often to go camping somewhere which would involve tents and no electricity, not 50' trailers with full kitchens, bathrooms and wifi, and if you were to go on a trip to another country or something, it was something the family saved up for and didn't happen every year. If something was broken, you fixed it instead of throwing it out and buying three more. 

While all of that might sound like it came out of Leave it to Beaver or The Brady Bunch, I grew up in the 90's. 

Now, ""middle class"" people are shopping for luxury/designer brand clothing, cars, and other goods. It's practically considered child abuse to suggest that kids share a bedroom or don't have their own computer, tablet, and phone, and there is no way they would wear clothing handed down or two years old. Suburban/small town homes are multi level McMansions with granite counter tops, stainless steel appliances, multiple big screen tvs, and master bathrooms with Jacuzzi tubs and rain showers. The family car is two or three cars, potentially more if there kids old enough to drive at home, and instead of the kids going for a weekend at grandma's while the parents drive three hours away for a vacation where they stay in a motel and go out for a nice dinner, the whole family flies to an all inclusive resort in another country. 

Yes, many of those things are cheaper than they once were, but many of them would have been considered luxuries or unattainable a generation ago and that would have been perfectly acceptable. Instead we lament the decline of the ""middle class"" while we continue to inflate what a middle class lifestyle is supposed to look like. 

tl;dr the ""middle class"" is shrinking because what used to be defined as middle class would currently be considered below it, and what is currently ""middle"" class would have been upper-middle to ""rich"" in the past. Instead of lamenting the decline of the middle class we should reevaluate how we define it. CMV

"Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and I encourage all men who have been sexually abused to immediately seek help, but I have trouble feeling as bad for men who are raped and it's hard for me to weigh the impact of that rape on their lives. 

The reason is because whenever I think of women getting raped, I think of a strong (and sometimes old) man who clearly has power of a much weaker woman forcing her to do things that she finds derogatory. The fact that women are the prominent gender in the sex slave trade doesn't help. That only makes me feel like a man raping a woman is essentially treating her like property and belittling her humanity. Also, although I can't prove this scientifically, we all know at least that society views men as horny fucks who are out there just to fuck women. This evokes some feeling in me that women are men's ""prey"" and they are the victims who have to put up with this feeling of worthlessness. 

Whenever I think of a man getting raped however, I think of a guy who has had a little too much to drink and is being coerced into sex by a woman who finds him attractive. Yeah, he may not want to have sex with her, and yeah at that point he is way too weak to resist, but because he's a man, there's something inside of me that feels like he can deal with this and it's simply just another night that didn't go so well. Now as for gay men, that's different and I can sympathize with them more, especially if they were the ones who were penetrated. Even though I feel that way with gays, I still don't think of rape of gay men as bad as rape of women.

I guess I may see being penetrated unwillingly as worse than having to penetrate someone against your will. But the fact that toughness and security are associated with males and feebleness and innocence are associated with women also doesn't help. 

I really do hate my stance on this because I like to think of myself as a benevolent person who wants the common good for everyone. Please tell my why I should think of male rape as bad as female rape. Again, I really want my view to change.

"To start off, let’s establish what pansexuality is. Googling the definition of pansexuality, we get an individual not limited in sexual choice with regard to biological sex, gender, or gender identity. 

Because the definition mentions both sex and gender, I think that it’s important to acknowledge the difference. Sex is scientific. The only way that one can change their sex is undergoing an operation that would change their sexual organs to resemble the other sex’s sexual organs. One cannot simply choose to identify as male or female— it is 100% genetic. Gender, on the other hand, is the whole of society’s view on the attributes of that sex. For example, a very simple society might choose liking cars to be a “man trait” and liking flowers to be a “woman trait”. This makes it very possible for a male to identify as a woman because he likes flowers vice versa. 

However, when discussing something such as sexuality (notice the sex part of the word), the concept of gender feels rather irrelevant. The term heterosexual, for example, is defined as someone who is attracted to the opposite sex. That’s it. The term doesn’t mention that the member of the opposite sex must like cars, flowers, males, females, or anything. A man that likes women with large breasts isn’t a “breast-sexual”. He is just a heterosexual who, just like almost everybody else, is slightly more complicated than loving every single woman he comes across.

Keeping this in mind, there are only two sexes according to biologists: male and female. There are rare cases where an individual might have parts of both sexes, but a sex is always determined nonetheless. Thus, speaking to which sex an individual is attracted to, there are only four possible sexualities:

1. Asexual – Attracted to neither sex
2. Homosexual – Attracted to the same sex
3. Heterosexual – Attracted to the opposite sex
4. Bisexual – Attracted to both sexes

This is what makes the term “pansexual” so unnecessary. Since a pansexual does not care about a person’s sex, they are attracted to both sexes. This makes them bisexual by definition. There is no need to add anything more to the word because sexuality is not meant to give a complete overview of what you find attractive. Otherwise, if people asked me my sexuality, I would say I am a brunette-female-who-is-shorter-than-me-but-not-too-short-and-has-a-good-sense-of-humor-as-well-as-an-appreciation-for-science-and-has-an-attractive-looking-face-sexual, which is absolutely ridiculous.TL;DR: Pansexuality is just a subset of bisexuality. This makes it an unnecessary term since almost all attraction is a subset of sexuality (I.e. A heterosexual male who only likes blondes) and we could not possibly give a term to each.




&amp;gt; Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things. Firstly, please remember to read through our rules. Happy CMVing!","{'he', 'man', 'male'}"
"Awhile ago, Facebook released several new genders - many of them seemed to come out of nowhere and almost all are incredibly confusing, over-the-top, and redundant. To preface this, I am not against anyone in the LGBT community and welcome the idea of gay marriage and things similar. However, I've never really been on-board with all these new genders. 

Anyway, some of the terms that come to mind are Agender and Androgynous. The mean the same thing, to not identify as any gender, so why are they two separate words? Genderfluid and Bigender seem completely redundant too - so, why even have them? I'm also not entirely sure why people can't just dress the way they want to while remaining whatever sex they were given at birth. 

Does it really matter if a man dresses as a woman? Does he really have to be classified as gender-fluid because it really just seems like a word that would be less blunt than cross-dressing. Again, I have nothing against that, but it seems like people are trying to make other words to someone glorify what they're doing.

Also, what's the deal with ""cis""?

 Cis-female.
 Cis-male.
 Cis-man.
 Cis-woman.
 Cisgender.

If the definition of ""cis"" is basically people acting within the confines of their gender, why can't they just be called women and men? Why do they have to have a special name? Considering that people are giving away names to things that already exist, it seems really indicative of how strong other words in their dictionary are (see: gender-fluid and bi-gender redundancy).

Again, I can't stress this enough, I have no issues with people being who they want to be and how they want to be that. It just seems overly unnecessary to have a million new Facebook gender options for things that clearly overlap each-other. A lot of this also seems more of a ploy for attention, not someone actually identifying as something.

With that being said, am I just seeing this the wrong way? I get incredibly annoyed when someone tells me they're ""gender-fluid"" or ""cis-female"". It makes me believe that I may be seeing this the wrong way - or maybe these terms really are inessential and pointless?

"In the workplace there is a clear stigma against people who choose to not marry and/or have kids. The married guy is seen as more stable, more reliable, more financially adept (somehow), and generally more mature. The man who is single is looked at with apprehension, if not suspicion. The married man needs time off? Sure, you need to take care of the kids! The single guy needs time off? What could you possibly need time off for? Get to work. 

What about people who are discriminated against on the basis of their race? Sexual orientation? These are protected classes under the rule of law. However, if a man is single, that is a life choice, and that is looked down upon.

A common response to this may be ""what about atheists? Surely atheists are more strongly discriminated against."" Atheism is something that is much easier to hide.

"I want children one day. Part of me wants to have my own children but I can't justify birthing my own kids when it's such an extremely selfish motive. Sure, once you've had the kids it's selfless because of how much you have to give up for them. But the initial desire to birth them in the first place is selfish. I want my own children because I want to carry on my own genes. I want to have a little human that resembles me.  As a woman, I want to experience the feeling of a baby inside of me. These reasons are the main reasons why people choose to birth their own kids. 
Here's a few reasons why I find it selfish.

1. There are plenty of children out there without parents. Over 150 million orphans, not to mention foster children. Then here are people who are trying to birth their own when there are so many helpless children without a loving home.

2. There are over 800 million people starving in the world. People are dying from hunger and you're trying to bring another mouth that needs feeding into the world.

3. This reason may be a little unexpected but it's something I'm personally afraid of and so I feel it's a valid reason. I'm agnostic. You can believe whatever you want about the afterlife but that doesn't mean you actually know what will happen to us after we die. Whether we go to a heaven, a hell, are reincarnated, cease to exist or whatever else people can come up with. You just can't  know for sure and anyone who says differently is lying to themselves. Now that being said, say hell is a reality. I hope it isn't but you never know. What if you birthed these children out of your selfish desire and they did just whatever it took to have themselves sent to hell forever. Even if you did pick the ""right"" religion doesn't mean that your child is going to believe it.

"Context: As I've been re-organize how I view the world lately, my very conception of Love has come under fire. When dealing with emotionally lofty concepts such as love and hate, things can get messy and abstract. Additionally, these are both words that are used in many different ways, but I am positing a specific semantic distinction that I feel applies to both Love and Hate. The mild caveat is that because people hyperbolize both words, they have lost some meaning colloquially, but if you conceptualize ""Love"" as romantic love or the feeling of being ""In Love"", it may be easier.
 
 
Argument: Both love and hate are on the same spectrum of a type of emotion. They are the very opposite extremes to an emotion that is felt by a human being so strongly that it actually destroys that person's ability to make rational, controlled, and logical decision making.
 
Hate is a little easier to understand, and I certainly contest that it’s an irrational emotion. Hate is experiencing feelings so negative and upsetting that one is unable to think rationally about the concept. If one hates a concept, a person, or a thing, and I mean actually hates – not just hyperbolic expression – then that person is undercutting even understanding their own reason for feeling the way they are. A person who hates a concept isn’t even willing, interested, or capable of thinking in a level-headed way about that concept. Stubbornness, blindness, willful ignorance or what have you, hate destroys the ability to reason. I’d contest that due to this, hate is never worthwhile and should never be applied to anything or anyone. There isn’t a singular concept, person, or thing that one should hate. Hitler, pedophiles, racism, malaria, or hot-pockets, actual hatred towards anything seems to imply a misunderstanding of the thing.
 
Love, on the other hand, is when you have emotions so positive about a person, place, or thing that the person who ""loves"" it cannot actually think rationally about that thing. That person is so caught up in the emotions that the ability to weigh out other perspectives, to reason in a different way, or to think objectively about that thing is quite literally disabled. In this way people often talk about romantic love. People may debate that experiencing love is obviously positive, and it brings about so many beautiful expressions… yet it can also lead to de-prioritizing important life events, self-survival, and contemplation of one’s situation. It's very, very rare to have someone so emotionally impacted over an object, however. One example might be Bruce Willis’s character Butch Coolidge in Pulp Fiction, who risks his life to retrieve a watch with significant sentimental value.


The true essence of experiencing love for someone or being in love, is then an emotion that simply disallows rational thought. It, like hate, has an inherent risk. While some desire this type of expression, it can be very unsettling and even dangerous to human beings.


As such, I believe both hate and love are on the same continuum. The actual expression of these emotions (and not merely semantic expression) is borderline unwanted. However, because the emotions that lead to those ends of the continuum are easy to quantify (happiness, pleasure, comfort vs anger, fear, disgust) one seems more appealing than the other.


Semantic Usage: I don’t believe that I am suggesting that no one should use these terms, because hyperbolic statements and exaggeration are natural to humans. I do believe that maybe, just maybe, there are better terms to express our unyielding, overwhelming expressions of positivity and negativity. It’s certainly healthier to identify a conscious dismantling of the thing one “hates” and advocate against it, logically and with supporting evidence. And it almost seems much sweeter to identify to a partner that your feelings come from a place of reasoned, mindful, and intentional consideration… and not just mere gut feelings.

Considerations: Do y'all think that Love and Hate are rational emotional expressions? Are there times that it's beneficial to a person to feel irrational? If so, then maybe Love and Hate aren't dangerous to experience all the time. Is my underlying assumption that irrationality is dangerous also wrong? When is it ok, and more specifically, when is experiencing Hate as I define it ok? 
 
TL;DR: Love and Hate both sit on the same spectrum of emotions. They are defined by emotions so strong that one actually is unable to think rationally when experiencing them. I contest that these are both dangerous emotions because irrationality is dangerous to a human being.

If you don't have those contingencies in place, or if you can't deal with the hardship of letting your child out of your sight, then that's one of the tough parts of life for you to deal with - not to inflict upon your helpless baby. 

Edit: I should have known better than to think people wouldn't use the downvote as a ""disagree"" button, although I will admit I probably deserve it for using such a hyperbolic and sensational title. I'm repeating what I said in a comment, but I want to clarify what I'm getting at: Any reason for a parent to have a baby on a plane is inherently ""selfish"" - there's no benefit to the child to being on a plane. So how is it right to put a baby at an increased risk of pain for one's own ""selfish"" reasons?",{'uncle'}
"I don't understand why people would enjoy watching anything with other humans they can relate to suffering and dying. I just don't get it.

"Well the title is pretty self-explanatory but recently with seeing all of my friends being super successful and happy on facebook as well as in real life, Ive become super depressed and really need help changing my view.

The good things about me:  Im kind, caring, a good friend, and an overall decent human being.  I have my own interests and career ambitions, I take care of my physique, and I dress well.

The bad things:  Everything that's in the title.  The whole ""size doesn't matter"" ""money doesn't matter"" ""sexual experience doesn't matter"" isn't shit I'm willing to believe.  Size matters, money matters, and sexual experience = more confidence.  The fact that I have none of these things has led me to fall into a negative cycle that I can't break out of.

Most attractive women of all races (even Indian women) aren't attracted to 24 year old virgin Indian dudes with a small dick.  That's not opinion, thats just fact.  Im not in med school yet either like the rest of my Indian family and friends, instead I got a research associate position at a med school doing cardiology research making a measley 35K a year before tax.  So its not like I have money or med school status either.

Please help me change my view that these negative beliefs aren't deal breakers for dating attractive women and that there are attractive women out there who are willing to see past all that.

Although I know that I do in fact need to be more confident and believe in myself more, you need to have the necessary ingredients for that to happen, such as money and career success.

"I'm not a cop hater. I like to think I'm a relatively reasonable person but I'm honestly not even 100% sure how I really feel with the constant barrage of news stories about police breaking the law and victimizing regular citizens.

I replied to another redditor saying to basically always do what a cop says here


Section of his comment
If a police officer asks you to do something, you do it. Pretty much without exception. If you wish to challenge the police officer's legal right to do something, the proper venue is in Court and not in the street.

and my reply
That's horse-shit buddy

Despite the sheer magnitude of the amount of recent cases of police blatantly abusing their power with zero retribution I am still of the opinion that most officers are genuinely decent people. But like any other human, they carry inclinations for benevolence AND iniquity.

Honest intentions sadly don't always equal righteous actions and authority must be challenged. Always. Full stop.


I'm not some edgy teenage anarchist. The police work for the public. They need to constantly be held accountable and should never be beyond reproach

You say the proper venue to challenge the police's legal right to do something is in the courts; I say the proper venue is any and everywhere.

I do believe this but reading it back to myself and trying to see it from someone else point of view I feel like I sound like some kind of deluded government conspiracy theorist.

EDIT: It's been pointed out that my title is shitty and misleading. I'll restate my position better but as of now I no longer hold that view specifically.

Cops have authority. I fully support that. I believe it's necessary for a society to function for there to be people to enforce the law by means greater than what the average citizen should be allowed.

I also believe those enforcers should be held to a higher moral standard. That they should not violate the reach of the powers we give them. And that if they do, we, the very people that gave them the power in the first place, have our own duty to not allow it despite such disobedience being an often unsafe and likely consequential undertaking.

Might doesn't make right. I definitely don't want to get my ass beat and/or thrown in jail for pissing off the wrong cop by not letting him violate my rights and despite my position I don't know if I would have the courage in the moment to stand up to a weaponized bully but I do know it would be the right thing to do. Maybe not the smart thing, but the right thing.

"Celebrating your birthday is the most attention whorish thing you could ever do. There really is no need to celebrate a birthday because you didn't do anything on that actual day. If anything, one should celebrate their mother or father on their birthday. They did all the hard work. When I see grown ups celebrate birthdays I cringe a little bit. 

The one exception is senior citizens (those who are past 65 years of age). Then it's acceptable to celebrate a birthday because it is a true celebration that you're still alive, and you could die soon.

Even worse is grown men who celebrate their birthdays &amp; throw parties to do so. If you're a grown man, there is no need to go out &amp; celebrate your ""birth"". 

I think one thing that should be celebrated is your work anniversary (or school year completion if you don't have a job). This is something that you have to put effort into, and requires something on your behalf that requires a cause of celebration.

"Admittedly Strip Clubs have come to be seen as a fun and even ideal environment for partying. The 'by-the-book' clubs don't allow clients to have sex with the strippers, though of course it most likely happens a lot and many strippers are prostitutes, but not all. The two jobs aren't all that dissimilar (sex work), though stripping is more of an art and I imagine the best performers take it quite seriously and don't sell themselves (cheaply).

On the client side, I think the only reason strip clubs came to be is due to a crackdown on 'out in the open' brothels and the type of men who would go to a strip club would also go to a brothel if they didn't feel like criminals. If brothels were legalized I can see some of those businesses eventually reaching a similar level of social acceptance, thus brothels will become more than a series of dark rooms full of sex-slaves and may become the amusing harems and menageries of historical fiction. 

I find that not only will clients prefer the legal brothel with a nice entertainment budget. Why just go watch a girl dance around naked? Why not touch her as you like and even have sex? Or watch people have sex etc. The type of men who regularly go to strip clubs most likely only go because they cant get attractive women to pay attention to them and are willing to deal with teasing and stripping because an illegal brothel can result in infections or jail time. 

I even suspect that the performers will end up working in brothels rather than strip clubs. Seeing as there are women who will have sex with them without legal repercussions men won't throw as much money at a girl who is just taking her clothes off. No doubt brothels will end up having some of the girls strip to entice clients to go into the back rooms with them. The artistic side of stripping, which only exists due to the illegality of brothels and male willingness to throw money at attractive women, will lose a great deal of funding and talent.

"NYC currently has two schemes for limiting rent: rent control, and rent stabilization.  Both of them should be abolished, though gradually.  I would propose that currently controlled units remain controlled, but that:

 Current units cannot be transferred to a new tenant.  If the original tenant on the lease at the time of the decontrol law vacates the unit, the unit can be listed by the landlord at market rates.  Currently, other occupants related to the lessor can inherit the lease, meaning units pass down in families indefinitely.

 Newly constructed or rented units are not subject to any controls.

 Rents in all controlled units can rise by up to 5% per year.

 Rent decontrol be coupled with large scale upzoning to allow more housing to come on to the market.  This will include infill construction in NYCHA housing projects where developers are willing to pay market rates for the land.

 Buildings which received Mitchell-Lama or other tax subsidies must pay back the subsidies with interest before decontrolling units which were built as a condition of the subsidy, on a pro-rated basis.

The reason I want to abolish rent regulations in NYC is that it drastically reduces the available housing supply and harms people looking to move to or within the city.  Anyone who has won the rent regulation lottery never moves out, and you end up with a highly inefficient allocation of apartments within the city.

It also hugely depresses the creation of new rental units within the city, because new landlords see what happened to old landlords who got stuck with controlled units.

I don't think there should be a property right in a rental.  If you want a property interest in the place where you live, you should buy it.  If you're renting, you should be subject to the market forces that come with that.

By the way, I would like to also mention how addicted I am to the show, without knowing why. This is the point of the CMV...I want to know if the show is actually good, or if this is just my one stupid show I can't not watch.

All this show does is build characters and engage the audience for a little while before the same old rubbish happens—someone you love dies horrendously. It's just so cheap on the level of jump scares in a horror movie. Only the horror movie's central plot is based around a few cheap jump-scares. That is what Game of Thrones is, only it's filled with mildly entertaining bits in between, and some steadily-improving CGI.

You know it actually reminded me of SEASON 1 SSSSSPOOOIILLLEERRRRR the fking torture scene where the guy helps Reek (forgot his actual name) escapes with the help of that guy, only for it to turn out to be part of the torture, as he is brought back to his captor and his hope is crushed to dust (and his dick is chopped off).

This idea hit me when I came across this NSFL video video of two men who stole potatoes getting beaten with bricks then burned alive. I was full of rage and anger thinking to myself how humans can be so extremely evil. Taking a persons life is already horrendous but doing it to a innocent person in this manner is just atrocious. 

But then I realized, this is the exact way civilians die in the cities we bomb and help bomb. When Israel bombs Gaza, what happens? Do the over 1000 civilians drift peacefully into death and become a statistic or do they suffer like in this video? Or when we relentlessly bombed Iraq, what happened to the people? Bombs cause fire. Bombs cause bricks to hit you. What's different? The fact that we don't see it? 

We all can agree that the perpetrators in this video are disgusting violent savages, but the pilot that does the same thing in Iraq is regarded as a hero. We can't even think for a second about how evil a person that does such acts is. A bomb both causes fires and ruble to fall on people. In fact, that's usually how most people die of airstrikes. So why do we call one person who does it a disgusting pig while the other we call a hero. 

It's no secret that nearly all our bombings result in civilian casualties so this leads me to the conclusion that all our bomber pilots are at the same level of the people in the video and thus are disgusting violent savages. CMV

"First, let me start off by saying I placed decide in quotations to note that I recognize people do not choose their gender identity. I believe that it is possible for born sex to conflict with your gender.

Now, with the recent news of an NAACP chapter president possibly lying about being black there has been some outrage at her deceit. She has come under intense scrutiny and anger from people all over the country. Understandable considering the fact that the likelihood that she is lying is high. 

That being said, what if one were not lying? 

Say that we have a child named Andrew. He's an orphaned white boy adopted by a black family who live in a predominately black neighborhood. Growing up he is surrounded by his black family and black friends where he experiences love and acceptance and comes to know nothing other than black American culture. 

Would it be unfair to say that this white boy when he grows up could claim he identifies as a black man? 

 But /u/doc_birdman, gender identity is a born trait while you're talking about a cultural influence!

Right, but I feel like that makes no difference. Nature does not outweigh nurture. A man may have his penis but may feel like a woman. Their natural physical state is a man, but their mental state is a woman. Andrew was born white but feels like he is ""black"", so physical state of white and mental state of being ""black"".

 What do you mean ""black culture""?!

Don't be silly, you know what I mean.

"I've researched the issue and come to the conclusion that transexuality is nothing but a big misunderstanding, please let me explain.

Society had a definition for ""man"" and ""woman"":

Man:
-Has a masculine body and male genitalia
-Has a masculine personality
-Is only sexually attracted to women

Woman:
-Has a feminine body and female genitalia
-Has a feminine personality
-Is only sexually attracted to men

Now society has progressed and homosexuality and bisexuality have become more accepted, and thus we have the following definitions:

Straight man:
-Has a masculine body and male genitalia
-Has a masculine personality
-Is only sexually attracted to women

Gay man:
-Has a masculine body and male genitalia
-Has a masculine personality (possibly a bit effeminate)
-Is only sexually attracted to men

Bisexual man:
-Has a masculine body and male genitalia
-Has a masculine personality (possibly a bit effeminate)
-Is sexually attracted to both genders

Woman:
-Has a feminine body and female genitalia
-Has a feminine personality
-Is only sexually attracted to men

Lesbian woman:
-Has a feminine body and female genitalia
-Has a feminine personality (possibly a bit emasculate)
-Is only sexually attracted to women

Bisexual woman:
-Has a feminine body and female genitalia
-Has a feminine personality (possibly a bit emasculate)
-Is sexually attracted to both genders

See the problem here? What happens when someone has a masculine body with male genitalia but a feminine personality? Or a feminine body with female genitalia but masculine personality? 

That's what society calls ""transexuality"", but that's a misconception, society can understand (now) a man that likes other men, possibly a man that acts a little effeminate, but they can't understand a man who wears dresses and loves the idea of being perceived as cute, just like society can't understand a woman who likes to have short hair and wear tough clothes and wants to impose herself and be perceived as powerful.

And for those people who defy the rule man = masculine, female = feminine, society calls them ""transexuals"", because it's somehow easier to comprehend the concept ""being a woman born in the body of a man"" and ""being a man born in the body of a woman"" than to understand that some men simply prefer to be feminine just like most women do and that some women simply prefer to be masculine just like most men do.

This is my point and I'm completely open to the idea that transexuality might be something beyond having the emotional profile of the opposite gender, so please try to reason with me :D

"This is something I've been struggling with for a while. There have been a few headlines lately that brought this topic up, namely about the new black Human Torch in the upcoming Fantastic Four reboot, people said this was a good step forward in the superhero film community, and even that changing the typically white role to an black role would add levels of complexity to the story. On the other hand, critics called Stone's casting ""culturally insensitive,"" despite Cameron Crowe stating that the fact she's predominantly white, and has to constantly explain her ""unlikely heritage,"" was an actual aspect of her character, based on a real life redhead with 1/4 Chinese heritage.

I don't mind casting people of color in typically white roles. I think it's good and it should be as inconsequential as POC involvement in other areas of life in the 21st century. In fact, in areas dominated by white characters, like the Marvel Universe, I'm completely open to the idea of adding more roles for POC. But when usually white roles are filled by POC, there's a lot of praise for reaching out and involving other races. Why not just focus on either creating films that feature black or other minority characters, like the Black Panther(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_(comics), or even start creating more original POC characters to reflect the changing racial landscape? Why is the casting itself of a mixed race character portrayed by a white actor ""insensitive?""

"Generally speaking, I could easily change my CMV to something to the extent of ""it's completely OK to not have any interest in women's sports if you're a fan of the male equivalent i.e. WNBA to the NBA."" however, given the FIFA Women's World Cup is being played this month, I figure I would give more focus to that competition.

I was having a conversation with a friend who is a fan of both the US National Team and the US Women's National Team, and when asked if I was going to hang out with him to see the Women's World Cup matches, I simply told him I did not have any interest in the tournament. He asked why, justifying his reasoning that if I support the Men's side, that the Women's side require just as much support from me in order to grow the sport for both sexes. 

While I am all for growing the sport of football/soccer in the United States, I just cannot care if the sport has success on the women's side. My simply reasoning is that the women's side of the sport is every way, shape and form, inferior to the men's side. To back up this, the USWNT was torched in a friendly in 2012 by the US Men's U-17 side with the final score being 8-2 (see more info here: http://forums.bigsoccer.com/threads/uswnt-vs-u-17-usmnt.1939180/). On the other token, I have quite a bit of interest in our U-17 and U-20 side, knowing that we have coaches raising these players with the potential of making the main side that competes in the Gold Cup and the FIFA World Cup. 

I am by no means saying that young girls shouldn't go out to watch the Womens World Cup if they feel compelled to.

"I am a biologist that has done some research on the evolution of sex in dioecious plants. This is a topic that has frustrated me from time to time over the last year or so.  Here on reddit and other forums I have run across phrases such as the following:

  Gender refers to a social construct and is not used interchangeably with biological sex


  There is no such thing as biological gender


  Sex is not gender/gender is not sex

I've also had a psychologist buddy of mine get on to me for misapplying the term gender when discussing the biological sex of a plant.
Now, I understand that the word gender can be used to describe a social construct and/or internal identity rather than refer to biological sex. Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the English language, where words can mean different things in different contexts. And this isn't just a colloquialism, where people have misused the term gender to the point where it has become commonplace. This is used all the time in biology to describe sex in species other than humans. See this paper on dioecious plant species. 
We even have a term in biology called gender load to describe a phenomena where there is a  continuous production of low-fitness offspring of
both sexes. If you are concerned that someone might not understand what they are talking about, use what I just laid out as a correction. Tell them they are confusing identity or social construct and biological sex. In the same way that you might tell someone opposed to gay rights that when you’re talking about marriage you are referring only to the legal contract between spouses and not what they think their god says. 

Furthermore, an etymology search( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=gender&amp;searchmode=none) of the word gender reveals that the word has long been used interchangeably with sex. 
So, tell me reddit. Am I a culturally insensitive bastard, for using gender interchangeably with biological sex in context? CMV.

I know my viewpoint is going to be the antithesis to most MRA's but I just find it hard to take their viewpoints seriously.

The amount of times I have seen that Toronto incident mentioned, it was 1 crazy group of people, its hardly a world wide phenomena. 

I do admit that there are issues facing on men, stuff like circumcision being seen as the norm in some places (more in the US, they aren't common over in England, unless you are uber religious) and as a guy who has had a male on male sexual assault I know that it won't be taken as seriously as a male on female assault. 

But you don't really see that much of that type of things on MRA, most of it seems to be complaining about Feminism, then you look at what feminism has done compared to MRA. Feminists fought tooth and nail to get the right to vote, chained themselves to buildings, went on hunger strike, went to prison for what they believe in; I haven't seen that from MRA at all. 

I also suppose being gay makes me somewhat sympathetic to Feminism, the queer rights movement has some parallels, I see those first people to resist at Stonewall as our suffragettes

For those who cherish animal life in a less arbitrary way it could seem like, this blood-thirsty mob has, for once taken, the correct side. But, this is an illusion-- we are are harmed by the inconsistency and emotion-driven fervor of these people who would suggest hanging as punishment for dog fights, then blithely eat chicken from a large producer, or smile at photos of their uncle posed with half-dead and suffocating sword fish.

I think there are important questions here, I don't have the answers either. My point is not that all of these actions are equivalent, but rather that they have more in common than many people care to acknowledge. I would not be sad to live in a meatless, leather-free future, it might make me feel old, like someone's homophobic grandma who tries, but can't quite shake deeply learned prejudice. But, I think we have no choice but to recognize the cruelty in our own culture as, at least, similar to the cruelty found in other cultures. Most people I know personally who care about these issues already think about this rather deeply, so my criticisms are not for them. Many animal rights activists do see the parallels but it is hard to hear their intelligent arguments over the din consisting of little but mad-vitriol over certain animals (especially dogs) being harmed in certain ways. This level of anger that never seems to show up for pigs, snakes and fish-- or for the actions of male hunters (but women who hunt can get death threats) much of this comes from people who, like me, use leather, kill and eat fish (or think it's normal) and buy products like eggs or bacon.

This consistency issue is a big deal to me because calling an action cruel in one context but normal or a sport in another speaks to an unwillingness to contemplate life from diverse perspectives. And there are so many things we ought to be questioning... beyond the torture of fish.

This critical moral question about how and if we can end much of this cruelty deserves an answer from humans who recognize the common joys and failings of each other. It should not be arbitrary, the result of cultural preferences.

"18% of children molested are boys.^&amp;dagger; 1.1% of the population are gay men.^&amp;dagger;&amp;dagger;
---

Anecdotally, the majority of gay men I've asked have admitted to being sexually abused as a child.

These statistics are only included to reveal what motivates this view, which I admit is both somewhat tenuous and unsettling. I can think of alternative explanations for these statistics, but they to me are less convincing, and I am hoping that another poster has thought deeply about this topic enough to reach some critical insight I may have overlooked.

&amp;dagger;
http://www.nsopw.gov/en/Education/FactsStatistics indicates that ""82% of all juvenile victims are female."" From this we conclude that 18% of juvenile victims are male.

&amp;dagger;
&amp;dagger;
Consulting Table 1 on page 7 of http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr077.pdf, we find that 2.2% of men are gay or bisexual. One half of the population are men. So, 1.1% of the population comprises gay or bisexual men.

I realize that the first statistic is not perfectly comparable due to the fact that some boys are molested by women, so I accounted for this and it doesn't make much of a difference:
""Women are the abusers in about 14% of cases reported against boys and about 6% of cases reported against girls.""

http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/types/violence/child-sexual-abuse.asp

So 86% of boys molested were abused by men. 0.860.18% = 15.48%. That's still over 14 times what we would expect given the assumption that gay or bisexual men rape as often as heterosexual men. There's clearly a link.

Note that this has little bearing on my feelings about how gays should be treated; whether you've had bad luck pre- or post-natal doesn't change my sympathy. However, this observation does have a strong impact on my beliefs surrounding, for example, how harshly pedophiles should be punished (with death).

"I am constantly seeing guys with the opinion that women are attracted more to a guys wallet than his appearance or who he is as a person. Of course there will be some exceptions where a woman is actually attracted to the financial opportunities with a guy, but I feel most women are more attracted to the other traits that most successful and wealthy people have.

The traits I'm referring to are passion, drive, ambition and confidence. A guy could have all of these things and direct them towards something like charity and the majority of women are still going to be very attracted to him. Most times though, these personality traits lead toward success which then leads to wealth.

It's easy to recognize expensive things like nice cars and clothing that we don't have and associate that as to the difference between ourselves and the stranger with the beautiful girlfriend. It's not easy to see a strangers personality as they are walking to their car in the parking lot of the shopping mall. It's human instinct to notice patterns and try to learn from them. It makes sense we would think that wealth and beautiful girls go hand in hand. But in reality, the girlfriend he has was not originally attracted to his wallet, but his hard work ethic and the confidence he had in himself and what he was doing.

Edit: I'd like to add competence as a major factor in what attracts a women to a man.

There is a large possibility that my terms of a metaphor not being equal enough to support an argument are broad, but I can not think over any way to narrow them down. Edit: Nitpicked was a bad choice of words. My argument is that anyone who uses a metaphor to support an argument or point can not use a sufficient metaphor to make their point. Here, I have found a good example. ""If God exists because you can not disprove his existence, then a magical purple elephant exists because you can not disprove his existence either"". This is an example of using a metaphor in an argument to prove a POINT, very badly. This is a bad use because their is no evidence of a magic purple evidence, but their evidence to why there wouldn't be a magic purple elephant. Any proof that a god has created the universe or that the universe created itself has not been presented making this an example of a bad metaphor in an argument.

"Hi Reddit. With all the news over the past couple weeks regarding Caitlyn Jenner’s transition and coming out, I feel now is a good time to discuss gender’s role in society and its position in how people identify as an individual. I would like to preface myself by saying that I identify as a pansexual cis-male, and I certainly have zero issues with people that are transgendered. I do, however, get very confused as to why some people are transgendered.


Many people use the phrase, “I am a male trapped in a female’s body,” or, “my body is male but my brain is female.” What does this even mean? From a very young age, people are raised with ideas imposed upon us that dictate what boys are and what girls are, and these perceptions have nothing to do with the biological sex of someone and are typically based upon baseless stereotypical personality traits or what that gender should like to do. We are taught boys should play with toy cars and tools while girls are supposed to like barbies and dresses. These stereotypes are completely disparate from the reality that people are often multi-faceted, and might like many things across several disciplines and across several “gender” boundaries. I, personally, love to wrench my own car, build things, and in the same day I might decide to look totally different and wear makeup as an artistic outlet or go out shopping with friends to look at heels. These interests have nothing to do with my biological sex, and shouldn’t have an affect on how I identify.


Society has dictated that girls do certain things and boys do certain things. What does this mean when someone who is anatomically male tends to like a lot of the things that the opposite gender stereotypically likes? I think it’s unfair to oneself to say, “I like girl things so therefore I’m a girl,” or, “I like looking like a girl so I’m a girl.” This idea of outward presentation equating to one’s gender identity seems restrictive to me. I question how many people would identify as transgender if these societal norms became antiquated and everyone was truly free to express all sides of themselves regardless of physical sex. It should not be odd to be a very “feminine” person (makeup, hair, dress, etc) and be anatomically male and identify as a male despite one’s outward aesthetic. There shouldn’t even be an emphasis in society as to what gonads someone possesses. I believe far less people would identify as transgender, especially considering some people that are transgendered do not want sexual reassignment surgery, if we, as a society, were more open minded about individuality instead of trying to group people together based on their gender. If one doesn’t even want to have SRS, but they want to live their life “as a wo/man,” how is this not simply perpetuating the heteronormative ideologies imposed upon us? One shouldn’t have to explain to society who they are with their gender just because they don’t fit into the false dichotomy of male/female.

"I legitimately don't understand how anyone could deny that 'privilege' (as a sociological concept) exists. To me, it's so obvious that certain groups receive beneficial treatment as opposed to other groups. On the whole, it's easier to be white than any other race, easier to be straight than any other sexuality, easier to be cis than to be trans, easier to be male than female, easier to be wealthy than to be poor. 

From what I hear, the most common argument from those who deny 'privilege' exists is that (to be reductive) a person with a particular privilege doesn't always sit on the top of the social hierarchy. For instance, a 'privilege denier' will say that privilege doesn't exist because rich blacks have better social outcomes than poor whites, or straight women face less discrimination than gay men. Therefore, white or male privilege doesn't exist, because these are examples of whites and men existing further down the social hierarchy than the people they are supposed to be 'privileged' above. 

I think this is willful ignorance. No one is suggesting that 'privilege' is a zero-sum game, or that some types of privilege are more 'valuable' than others, or that all privilege exists in all situations. Privilege is privilege. A wealthy black man may have a higher income, but that won't stop him being pulled over by the cops or detained when trying to enter his home. A gay man will be subject to homophobic slurs and threats of violence, but a straight woman will be cat-called and endure sexist jokes and sexual harassment.  

Unless you're a black, gay, poor, MtF trans-person, you experience privilege in some portion of your life. You probably don't notice it, because it's the way things have always been. But it's willfully ignorant to say that you're not 'privileged' because some people are in a better station than you are. 

To change my view:

Help me understand why people deny privilege, that isn't rooted in 1.) willful ignorance (citing Tumblr or other sources of bad information on the concept) or 2.) entitlement (""I'm part of a supposedly 'privileged' class: why isn't my life amazing?!?!"") 

I'd like to stay away from arguments from so-called 'privilege deniers' as I think I've explained above why I don't think their arguments hold water, but if you think you've got an argument that dismantles the whole concept of 'privilege': lay it on me.

"Humanity plays an out-sized role in the Federation. Given the numerous races and population of non-humans in the Federation, there's an inexplicable abundance of humans in high positions. It's understandable for the organization to be based out of San Francisco, where the 4 founding races formed the coalition of planets, but with 150 member planets spread over 8,000 light years, why is so much of the leadership human?

This isn't a superficial skin-color thing, we're dealing with marked biological differences between the races. Vulcans, despite their violent past, have achieved ""superhuman"" levels of mastery over their emotions, allowing them to become excellent administrators and politicians, and even if we were to assume that Humans and Vulcans have the same fundamental capacity for intelligence, Vulcan discipline gives them supreme focus to produce an inordinate concentration of highly educated citizens. Even in sheer physical prowess, Vulcans massively outclass Humans, ""Take me out to the Holosuite"" being an excellent example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Me_Out_to_the_Holosuite

Here, the Vulcans are shown to be physically far superior, DOMINATING the mixed-race (human dominant) crew fielded by the Human Captain, in a human sport, with a final score of 10-1. Nevertheless the crew of DS9 celebrate their single point as a victory of human will rather than learning from the experience that Vulcans are superior in so many ways. 

Vulcans are known for logic, they take great efforts to avoid letting their emotions cloud their judgement. We all know of a prestigious Human starship captain for ignoring the odds in a situation and taking great risks over the protests of his even-keeled Vulcan officer. It's convenient that luck favored the crew so often after these brash and illogical decisions. These apparent ""successes"" for making the wrong decision only served to stroke this captain's ego and belief that his ""gut instincts"" are what qualify him to lead. How is this different from a foolish business executive making random decisions and claiming credit for successes, and blaming other factors for failures? The meritorious act is in the decision itself, not in the outcome. To judge the brash decision based on a fortunate outcome is a flawed post hoc reasoning, akin to throwing a dart, sliding a dartboard under it, and claiming an excellent throw! What if even a few of those risks resulted in the likely outcome where many if not all of the crew members were killed because the captain ignored the logical choice in favor of an unsupported gut decision? 

If there are any flaws to be noted in the Vulcan people as a whole, it would be low birth-rates, a bias towards peace, and a relative lack of ego(despite whatever projections humans perceive in a Vulcan's taciturn face). Perhaps humans have seized so much power as a direct result of greed, ambition, and nepotism, allowing them to promote humans above more qualified non-human members of Starfleet? Nevertheless, it seems clear that Vulcans are superior to humans.

"For the record, I am Pro-Choice. However, I often hear Pro-Life politicians and others advocate exceptions for abortions in these circumstances. Many Pro-Lifers will concede that abortion can be appropriate when the mother's life is at risk. However, if a person truly believes that abortion is murder, but they are okay with abortions when the child is a product of rape or incest, by their values, does that mean they are stating that ""murdering"" an ""innocent"" is okay because of how they were conceived? I would love to hear some serious explanations of the rationality behind this view.

Edit 1: /u/raptor6c I think offers a pretty effective conceptualization of the rationale. I still disagree with the implications of the position, but I definitely better understand the thought process. In his words:

Murder and 'voluntary termination of another life' do not mean the same thing and are not semantically interchangeable. 'Voluntary termination of a human life' is a quasi-objective description of an event (I say quasi because I don't want to draw arguments about free will being subjective into the discussion). Murder has a connotation of 'unlawfulness' or 'injustice' as a required part of its application. Formally I would say murder is the unjust and voluntary termination of a human life. The key distinction being that the quasi objective event of a 'voluntary termination of a human life' may be either just or unjust depending on the circumstances of the event in question.

Given this one can simultaneously hold the positions that 1) abortion is voluntary termination of a human life, 2) voluntary termination of human life is unjust except for in well defined scenarios, 3) being a victim of rape or incest is a scenario that justifies the termination of a human life if that life is one that was conceived by said rape or incest, and 4) no other scenarios besides 3) may justify an abortion.

Thus it would be coherent to believe that abortion is murder unless rape or incest led to the conception.

Edit 2: Let me clarify that this discussion is focused primarily on someone who identifies as Pro-Life, equates abortion as murder, and advocates outlawing abortions except in the cases of rape and sometimes incest.

"As more and more people in the developed world are becoming obese, many governments have begun to tax various foods they deem unhealthy because they are allegedly contributing to this epidemic.  While pigovian (no pun intended) taxes of this kind may have been effective for things like alcohol or tobacco, I believe they only work when the tax makes up the majority of the price of the product.  An extra ten cents on his morning can of gravy isn't going to make fatso switch to Slimfast.  

Unfortunately doubling or tripling the price of junk food would completely destroy the market for these things and put manufacturers out of business almost immediately.  This is because there are easy untaxed alternatives to junk food, unlike booze and cigarettes.  Granted you could grow your own tobacco and brew your own beer, but that takes months, while making junk food from tax-free ingredients takes minutes.  Plus if a steak cost the same as a bag of chips people would simply become obese on sirloin rather than Doritos.  
Raising the price of food like this would also be harmful to the poor, especially considering junk food often provides the most calories for your dollar, and is thus essential for many poor people to meet their daily nutritional requirements.  Say what you want about a diet high in fat and sugar, it's still healthier than starvation.

In addition it's grossly unfair to punish everybody when it's only the obese that need to cut back.  Even alcohol and tobacco would be relatively harmless in moderation, but in practice it would be too difficult for a vendor to tell if someone is an alcoholic chain-smoker or if they have self-control.  On the other hand, much to their chagrin, nobody has ever mistaken an obese person for slim, no matter how strong the elastic in their girdle.

Unfortunately if such a system were implemented many fatties would cheat it by having skinny friends or relatives buy their junk food for them.  The only viable solution as I see it would be not to tax food, but rather pants, say by $5-10 per inch the waistline is larger than the inseam.  This would ensure that only the fat would have to pay fat taxes.

Because if taxes are going to get raised that means I have to pay for my own loans that are going to take 10 years plus extra taxes so people can go for free?  That is not fair and while it seems nice, I don't have the money for that.  Nor, I'm sure, do most Americans.  

And what happens with private institutions?  Does that mean through my taxes I am paying for someone to go a $60,000 school when I couldn't go to one myself because I couldn't afford it?  Maybe that seems selfish, but that does not seem fair.  And the government should not be able to force me to pay so other people can get an easier life when I myself did not get that chance.  By the way, I know I am already being forced to pay for things I don't want, but shouldn't we be trying to lessen those instances instead of adding to them?

Any slack-jawed yokel can look up the right answer. The average person, given infinite time (or even a few days) could get a perfect score on just about any multiple choice or short answer based open book exam, even without any experience or knowledge of the topic on the exam. 

Therefore, open-book exams become a pure time test. This isn't to say that they are inherently easy, but what is being tested is not internalization of the subject matter of the material, but rather how quickly the student can read and flip pages. This is a skill in itself of course, and a worthy one, but it's not proof of mastery of the course material unless the course is about speed reading and page flipping. 

To truly test the student's actual knowledge of a particular subject matter, you must see what that student can produce given nothing but what he or she has learned throughout the course. This requires a closed-book examination.

"I've seen a lot of people on reddit who, when someone mentions people being prompted to give their pronouns, react as if this is a bad thing. The near-unanimity of these feelings against this practice have led me to question my own view, so I came here to see what y'all think.

There are a few reasons why I think this would benefit society as a whole:

1. Helping trans (and cis!) people not be misgendered. Most men don't like being mistaken for women, and most women don't like being mistaken for men. This includes trans men and trans women, who likely have to confront it more often (and, on top of that, who can see it as yet another unwelcome reminder that other people don't see them the same way they see themselves). Right now, people are generally expected to assume the gender of the people they meet based on appearances, but that clearly isn't reliable, especially when it comes to trans people. If asking for pronouns becomes normal, these awkward interactions will be eliminated.

2. Bringing trans acceptance into the mainstream. One of the biggest obstacles I've seen to trans acceptance is the attitude that we can, or we should be able to, tell a person's gender just by looking at them. The very act of asking for someone's pronouns assumes that you can't tell just by looking, so this change would entail acceptance of the fact that you can't assume someone's gender just by their appearances.

The only downside I see to this is the trivial amount of time it would take to ask the question and the effort of remembering people's answers, which hardly seems more difficult than remembering someone's name, once you've gotten used to it. 

Obviously I think this would be difficult to do and would take a while to actually become mainstream (if it ever does), so an argument that ""it's just too difficult to do this"" would probably be unlikely to change my view. My argument is that a world in which this social norm exists would be better than a world without that, and that this is something we should at least strive for.

"I'm a huge fan of Star Wars. The movies and the EU so for the purposes of this discussion, I'd love to include the EU as well.

But here's my thinking. Darth Vader is always seen as the ultimate badass. A tall powerful Sith lord with an awesome personal ship and his own Star Destroyer. He is the epitome of an intergalactic villain. 

However, I'd say that according to the traditional Sith myths (including the Bane and post-Bane era), he was the least influential and least ""Sith"" out of everyone. Every memorable Sith lord before him had some kind of ambition that lead them to where they were. 

Bane created the rule of 2 and started building a vast information/money network for generations to come. He also restored a ton of old Sith lore and knowledge.

Plagueis learned how to bring people back to life and used his power to manipulate Palpatine into Chancellorship.

Sidious..well, he created the Empire.

Vader on the other hand is a manipulated victim of his circumstances and while he did strike fear into the hearts of the citizens of the Empire, he didn't contribute much as a Sith lord. He didn't expand the Sith rule, nor did he learn anything new, nor did he have any drive whatsoever to do anything. When Vader originally turned, it was partially because he wanted to have power like Plagueis (to restore the newly dead and prolong life) but he immediately dropped it after his beloved's death. 

We saw Vader try to overtake Emperor but with someone else's help. It's like he didn't crave the Sith Lord mantle, he just wanted to get rid of his maniacal master.

We all know he's a skilled mechanic and pilot but he didn't do anything with that. Out of all the Sith, he could have restored the use of Force-infused craftsmanship but he didn't. As a Sith pilot, he could have explored unknown reaches of the galaxy and expand the Empire's influence beyond known galactic space (finding new hyper routes, enslaving nations, etc.) but he didn't.

So all in all, his contributions to the Sith were minor and he could hardly even be considered Sith.

"EDIT: Okay fellas. Time for me to hit the hay. You've all given me a lot to think about and while I still haven't moved in my position it's possible that as I digest all this information I might.





I was browsing the internet reading some articles discussing trans-sexuality when I stumbled upon an article debating whether or not trans people (specifically ones who had surgery to alter their sexual organs) should be morally, or even legally, obligated to disclose their biological sex to their potential partners before any sexual activity took place.

I thought this over for awhile and came to the conclusion that they absolutely should. I now believe that it is incredibly insensitive, bordering on criminal, not to disclose this information.

Imagine you're a Male-to-Female trans whose had sex-surgery. It's late on a friday night and you're really hitting it off with a guy at the bar. One thing leads to another and you end up at his place where you start to get intimate. At this point you must know that it is an almost statistical certainty that you are dealing with a straight male (Roughly a 96% chance). You also must know that he is almost certainly under the impression that you are a female in both name and biology. However, you know that the latter is not true. No matter how you slice it, you are not a biological female but a male who has had sex-reassignment surgery.

Let's stop right there for a moment.

Where I come from if you are participating in a social transaction and are aware that the other party has been given a false-impression of what the transaction entails, it would be wrong to progress until you rectify their misunderstanding.

Imagine this:

I'm walking down a downtown street and see a homeless man laying on the sidewalk. I walk up to this man and pull out a seemingly ordinary quarter.

I say to the man laying down: ""Ya' know I have an amazing ability to predict whether or not a coin will land heads or tails when flipped?""

He replies: ""No I did not but perhaps I could put that coin to better use than just flipping it?""

I reply: "" How about a little wager. If I correctly guess what side this quarter lands on 10 times in a row you owe me $10. If I guess incorrectly even once you win $10 plus the quarter."" 

The man agrees to the wager figuring it's unlikely I could correctly guess a coin flip 10 times in a row.

I then reveal that the quarter I hold is actually double headed. Obviously I win the bet and take what little cash the man had with me.

Was I morally bankrupt? Of course I was. I violated the man's trust. I intentionally went out of my way to deceive him into an unwinnable wager with a play on words and subtle suggestions. According to the logic of some in the trans community however, it wasn't my responsibility to correct the misconceptions he had even though I specifically set it up in such a way so that it was more likely for those misunderstandings to arise.

But I digress, let's get back to our individuals from the bar shall we?

By now you're both completely naked and the man sees that you have what appear to be real breasts and a real vagina. He has almost no reason in the world to believe that you are not a women. Again, however, you know that his assumptions are incorrect. You are a biological male who has altered their body to look and operate SIMILAR to a female's.

Finally you have sex and the next morning you inform the man that you are actually trans. The man immediately regrets having sex with you. Not only because he is not sexually attracted to transsexuals but also because he believes you abused his trust.

Now there are some who would still argue that if the man had such a problem with having sex with a transsexual he should have mentioned it beforehand. To which I counter with:

1: A man is naturally 5 foot 5 inches tall. He decides to go overseas to receive height-enhancement surgery to increase his height by 4 inches thereby making him 5'9. He returns to the US and a few months later he goes to a sperm bank to donate sperm. The form he has to fill out asks him to accurately state his height. He lists it at 5'9. 

While that man did not lie, he gave information that he knew was misleading. This information could greatly affect the choices of a women looking for a surrogate father. He argues that if the sperm bank really cared about his natural height, they would have explicitly stated as such.

2: One day a man returns home from work to find his fiancee having sex with their neighbor. He freaks out and asks why she would do something so terrible to him to which she simply replies ""You never specifically told me I couldn't screw other guys. If it meant so much to you, you should have mentioned it"".

Obviously that logic is ridiculous. In America, when you enter a serious relationship with someone you are agreeing to an unwritten, unspoken social contract. One of the default conditions of that contract preclude having sex with anyone that is not your significant-other. If you are seeking a relationship that does not operate within this social contract then YOU are the one that needs to speak up and inform your partner beforehand.

(I want to make it clear that I do not hate transsexuals. I do not find them evil or unclean. I do believe something is wrong when you know an individual in a serious situation is being misled and do nothing to inform them of it. Especially when you know that the information you give them could drastically alter their course of action.)","{'his', 'he', 'him', 'man', 'male', 'guy'}"
"This topic started bothering me specifically after the ""Christian Pizza restaurant refusing service to gay weddings"" issue which I'm sure most of you have heard of. I believe it can be justifiable for people who carry deep values and beliefs to discriminate against those who commit acts which makes the other person deeply uncomfortable as it is, to them, an act of blasphemy and such. We cannot force people to go against their own beliefs, and sometimes this will cause incidents of discrimination. I believe that although rare, it is justifiable to discriminate if the other group's acts are radically going against your belief and serving them will make you feel like you committed a sin against your beliefs and values. So for example, I believe that the pizzeria should be allowed to refuse service to a gay wedding, if he feels like doing that will violate his belief system. I am not a religious person but I recognize that certain people have very deep beliefs which they cannot shrug off, and we should be more tolerable.

"Snowden leaked classified information, which is a crime, but the circumstances of the leak, and how he did it, are such that he deserves to be pardoned.

Snowden did not leak for personal gain, but for public benefit.  He did not sell secrets to a foreign power.  The programs he revealed were illegal(https://www.eff.org/files/2015/05/07/aclu_v._clapper_-_court_of_appeals_opinion.pdf).  If he had not been a national security employee, his actions would have been covered by the whistleblower protection act, and not be a crime at all.

Two years on from his leaks, it is clear that Snowden has not acted in a way deserving of legal punishment, and it would be better for the United States if he were to be pardoned and allowed to return home, instead of his looming prosecution, especially considering that he could not raise a public interest defense(https://freedom.press/blog/2013/12/if-snowden-returned-us-trial-all-whistleblower-evidence-would-likely-be-inadmissible) at trial.  

Snowden broke the law.  But the pardon power exists precisely because the law does not cover all possible contingencies, and there is supposed to be the possibility of mercy in an exceptional case.  Snowden's case is nothing if not exceptional, and he should be pardoned.

Edit:  Ok, I'm heading to bed now.  Thanks for all the responses, I'll try to catch up on more tomorrow - this thread kinda blew up on me.

Edit 2:  I've awarded a delta to /u/MrApophenia who convinced me that the first-best solution would be for Snowden to return to the US on the condition, which he's publicly agreed to, of a trial where he can raise a public interest defense.  If convicted at that trial, a pardon might still be considered.  This would require an assurance that the espionage act charges be permanently dropped.

"Hello there. 

I am a 24 year old male from Bangladesh. Excuse my terrible grammar, English is not my native language. I am a Muslim male on paper and not religious at all; although I do strictly adhere to much of the important cultural and social values of the subcontinent. I have never studied philosophy and I find the subject to be complicated, so please try to answer in simple, everyday argumentative terms. 

Anyways, the thing is, I have some self-esteem issues. I am short, ugly etc. I hate myself and my life. I have been going over several self-help resources on self-esteem. I have read Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Dummies, Boosting Self-Esteem for Dummies and several other resources---from online articles to booklets. It seems to me that there is an underlying theme to all these:

 Do not globally attach a label to yourself. 

I find this approach to be grossly flawed, dangerous and purely Western-centric and not applicable to other cultures. Especially not mine. 

The above mentioned resources claim that humans are too complex to be globally labelled or rated. Therefore, they should give up attaching a label to themselves. If they ever have a thought ""I am bad"", they should counter it by saying ""I have other good qualities too"". 

Now this is all fine when we are talking about petty mistakes or crimes. However suppose hypothetically speaking we apply this approach to a murderer who is suffering from self-esteem issues. He believes and thinks that ""He is bad"". Should he use this approach to make himself feel better by saying ""I am a murderer and I kill people. Although I should not call myself a murderer and instead I should consider all the other good qualities that I have"". This is insane!! 

This approach might go well with the western view where retribution is frowned upon, however its totally incompatible with my culture. In the Islamic (and also the subcontinental) culture, there is a strong culture of retribution. A murderer who kills for evil reasons is to be punished by death and is to be burned forever hereafter. There is NO scope for him to feel good about himself or redeem himself. I am not going to argue whether this cultural approach is better or worse then the Western one. The only issue here is that I find this philosophy to be highly flawed, dangerous and not applicable to other cultures.   

Looking forward to hearing your side of the arguments.

"I'm referring to this news story about the incident at the community pool in McKinney TX.  You can reference it here, the video is down the page and is approximately 7:23.  http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/mckinney-texas-officer-leave-after-wild-pool-party-video-surfaces-n371281

I believe the premise is simple, if cops arrive on scene due to multiple reports of violence and encounter a large group of people and they are told to disperse and some refuse, they can be detained.  If they resist being detained, they can use force to detain you.  I'm not a lawyer or law enforcement, but I think this is how it works and is common sense.  Age or race does not preclude someone from following lawful orders.

You can see the order here (https://youtu.be/l4VayHJzaJU?t=2m20s ), she instead steps off in the opposite direction and is still talking at the cop, at which time he tries to detain her and she physically resists via pushing and pulling.  The cop in turn tries to push and pull her to the ground.  

During her active resistance, a couple young gentleman approach in what initially seems an aggressive manner, with one of them moving their hand to their waste.  In hindsight, and slow motion on youtube, you can see that he was pushed towards the officer and off balance, but there was no way for that cop to know that at the time, so he drew his gun and backed them off.  I'm guessing that police are probably trained to do this.

The entire event concluded with one adult arrested, everyone else released and no injuries.  

I think with all of the seriously horrible high profile police brutality in the news as of late, this story is getting caught up in America's typical response of reacting in an overly politically correct fashion, but I could be wrong.

"These things typically supercede evidence and reason:

 The respect you have for the person presenting the idea, and the respect he shows you.

 Whether the idea requires rearranging a lot of other ideas in your mind that depend on it. That's uncomfortable.

 Does the idea go against your group identity? If believing it will make you not fit in as well with your friends, you'll feel like resisting it.

Letting these things stand in the way of an intellectually honest assessment of the evidence will result in beliefs that are less representative of reality. Believing things that aren't true has all kinds of harms. One example: climate deniers block efforts to curb emissions.

There are fringe cases, like you wouldn't want to upset your dying Grandma by holding her to the highest possible standards of reasoning if it will make her last hours on Earth uncomfortable. 

But for smart, healthy thinkers, evidence and reasoning are the only good ways to determine truth, and all the other factors (which may have social and mental health benefits), should be set aside in favor of skillful critical thinking.

EDIT: To clarify my first bullet point: a disrespectful person can have accurate ideas that are hard to accept because of their bad attitude, and if you feel disrespect toward a person, you might dismiss all their ideas, even true ones. Positive respect for authorities can also lead you astray if not tempered by reasonable skepticism.

"I'm seeing posts everywhere regarding the ""safe space"" that reddit is destined to become under the new CEO's leadership, but have not been able to find any agenda from Pao herself that seems controversial at all: the only thing I've seen her say is that she's concerned about harassment and threats, and I would argue that both of those issues are not only deserving of attention, but not at all shocking. I've also seen people say that subreddits critical of Pao have been removed, but there are always other factors at play in the comments and there are several still going, plus about five front page posts per day about what a horrible person she is, so I don't know if I can call that censorship either.
In short, I feel that the predictions about reddit becoming an environment that bans free speech or whatever are wildly overblown. Ignoring her personal life (which, scandal ridden or not is irrelevant to her performance at reddit) can you change my view?

Here I also might need to concede that even if subs devoted to harrassment were banned (CoonTown, fatpeoplehate, etc etc ad infinitum), I don't think reddit or the world would be losing anything of value. I'm embarrassed to tell people I come here because of those subs, and I don't think that reddit or any privately held corporation is under obligation to host anything of that nature. So while I don't see them getting removed, I wouldn't she a single tear if they did. This is of course a different debate, but one that likely plays a role in my view here.

"Seriously, I don't understand why everyone on the show seems to dislike him or be fed up with him. A lot of his jokes/gaffes/mannerisms are genuinely funny even out of the context of the show. I think a lot of people would love to have a fun/goofy boss like him. I'm not even sure if the writers wanted to go for a realistic portrayal of office life, or write all the characters to dislike Michael for comedic effect. For example, I just recently saw an episode where he creates an orientation video for the new employees after the merger (Season 3, Episode 8 ""The Merger"") and the video is downright HILARIOUS, yet one of the employees straight up says he doesn't find it funny and questions wether it was even intended to be funny. I don't see this as even remotely realistic. 

Edit: Additionally, a lot of the things he does that seems to offend or anger characters are done because he genuinely believes what he is doing is right or is the nice thing to do.

"Before you downvote me, please hear me out and try to CMV with a well articulated comment. I would like to keep this a civil discussion without resorting to shutting people up with downvotes.

I will try to explain my opinion.
WARNING: looong rant ahead.

I first watched Breaking Bad. 
I've never been into TV shows since they tend to be time consuming and (IMO) tend to appeal to a broader audience, but since everyone told me to watch it I did. 

There are definitely some high points in the show: Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Giancarlo Esposito gave terrific performances, and without them I think the show would not have had the success it had. 
Gus' arc is IMO the peak of the show, with Gus' back story and general awesomeness. 
The other characters though, feel irrelevant and without much to offer. There is the cop who conveniently discovers Heisenberg's identity on the toilet, his wife who is just... There, and the same goes for Walter's son. Skylar is a hypocrite and exists only to judge others from her morality horse. The other villains are forgettable and the psycho that appears towards the end of the show is a convenient plot device to kill Jesse's love interest and doesn't have any interesting trait. He's completely unidimensional. 
In the end, the series felt like an action movie with a few interesting characters and some pretty good cinematography, but nothing mind blowing. 

I still liked it though and I can see why people like it but if this is considered the best TV show ever, then I question TV shows' quality. 


Now for Game of Thrones: I didn't read the books nor do I intend to unless it's significantly better than the show. 

I will try to keep my cool but I really DESPISE this show. I feel about it the same way I feel about Attack On Titan (yes, I hate that one too): interesting premise, terrible characters and pacing, and lots of CHEAP. SHOCK. VALUE. 

The show always goes for the most shocking outcomes for the sake of shock value. People praise this show for being unpredictable and killing off anyone without distinction. Yet all the people who die are COMPLETE FUCKING IDIOTS and their deaths feel forced to avoid, god forbid, that the story might start getting going. 

When the Stark guy knows the King's wife has an incestous affair and suspects her to have tried to kill a fucking child, the guy who loves his wife tells him not to trust him and his daughter tells him about people wanting him DEAD he just claims the Iron Throne without considering that maybe, just MAYBE, he could get arrested/killed. 

He could singlehandedly fix the corruption of the South, or at least try to while others tried to kill him, but we can't have that, now can we? The story must keep not going anywhere. If his death could have been at least plausible then it would have been okay.

Then there is the dragon girl, who gets married to someone she doesn't love, is raped and then just falls in love with him. Dafuq, Stockholm's syndrome maybe?

And at the end of season 3 we have other Starks dying because they're complete fools. Marrying another woman when you have already promised to marry the daughter of a powerful ally sure is a bright move, Einstein! After that I just dropped the series.

It's just like a soap opera, with tons of violence and sex, where characters who are considered ""grey"" are just flat without any interesting development other than the dwarf (I don't even remember those guys names) and maybe the Stark tomboy little girl and the Stark who is at the Night Watch. There is a woman with an incestous affair with his pretty brother, a king who likes drinking, eating and fucking, a king who's a naive imbecile, a dragon girl with Stockholm's syndrome who becomes a badass cuz DRAGONS, a psychopathic teen king who somehow still hasn't died in 3 seasons, a guy whose penis makes the thinking and dooms his family to death, etc. 

THIS is considered good TV. If this is the best TV has to offer, then I don't even want to bother watching any more of it.

"If one party decides to pay for the other, that's out of their generosity and that's up to them. But the more well-off person should not be criticised for only paying for their half. 

Since some people are old-fashioned and tend to expect for the man to pay for the woman, how about we reverse the role? Should a woman from an affluent background have to pay for a man who earns less than she does? Sure, if she wants to pay for him, that's up to her. But should she be frowned upon because she only pays for what she is spending on?

Also, if you are a successful businessman/woman, isn't paying for only your bit on a date a way to weed out (some of) the gold diggers?

I believe that the person with the higher earning should be allowed to spend their money on their wishes. They are not obliged to spend it on somebody just because they are more fortunate, although doing so can be an act of kindness.

Paying for the other person, as a more financially well-off person, is a generous gesture but should not be frowned upon if they only pay for their half.

I have noticed that many people tend to criticise the higher earner if they do not pay for the other person on a date.

"If Edward Snowden had revealed NSA secrets during a republican administration, he would have received more support from left-leaning politicians and from liberals and democrats.  Because he presented as a libertarian, and was perceived to have attacked the Obama administration, democrats and liberals were not receptive to his disclosures.   

Republicans generally tend to be supportive of a strong military defense, and so the NSA's actions naturally align with republican leanings.   

So, he received no support from the republicans or democrats, and this has played a part in how his message has been framed in the media, and what our political representatives say about him.

EDIT:  /u/NorbitGorbit changed my view.  He pointed out that following 9/11, both parties went along with passage of the Patriot Act and other government actions (the establishment of the Homeland Administration), and so the climate was supportive to surveillance across party lines.

"This view will be broken down into a few main points; Lack of Training, Corruption, Abuse of Power, and conclude with Overall Role of the President.

 Lack of Training

The primary and most notable is that the President doesn't need any no formal training or experience with the Army. Now it may be true that the brunt of the responsibility for this is in the hands of the Generals but the fact that a no experience individual gets such influence on the behavior of the largest army on the planet, is just absurd. The president can go against the council of those generals and against the council of the CIA which has been seen many times in the last few decades.

 Corruption

Having a single person with this much power over the army lends itself to corruption either from the outside or even worse, corruption from that individual who would use the army for personal reasons. For example, George Bush 2nd invaded Iraq in part due to the fact that Osama Bin Laden had attempted to kill George's dad in the past. He made the move with the army against the recommendation of the CIA who said the attacks came from Saudi Arabia, to get the man who hated his daddy.

 Abuse of Power

It is frankly idiotic that the person in control of the army, can use that as a resource to gain 'Emergency Powers'. This is just a perfectly exploitable glitch in the system. This is made especally potent when you take into account that the president for some reason doesn't need permission from congress to go to war, invade another country, or deploy the military any way they choose.

The president also can abuse their power to get money that could circumvent the power of congress, allowing this one person to circumvent many powers of the legislative branch, and judicial branch; goodbye checks and balances. This still occurs through documented selling of firearms over seas after a 'totally legit invasion' of panama, iraq, or wherever else. 

 Overall Role of the President

The president is a figure head more than anything, cluttering the role of the president with control over the armed forces just adds unnecessary strain to the role of the president who should focus on being Head of State and communication with the public, not foreign affairs, the state of the army, or anything of the sort.

 Conclusion

So what should the president be of not commander in chief? What the president is now; Head of State and Head of Government. I see no issue with having the elected office of the president simply being a figurehead role, and having commander in chief be a separate role chosen either by the president or through a panel with The Generals of the Army.

Many people say the president actually has less power than people think, and this is true because many people think the president controls legislation, which they do not. But the president does have more power than a single individual in a balanced government should have; power of the army, power of uncontested 'emergency powers', and a nigh endless amount of unbounded cash to use globally.

 To CMV

I must see a reasonable argument as to why each of these is wrong because if even one of them stands it is a legitimate reason to remove the Commander in Chief title from the Presidency.

or

You must show a reason why transferring the role to a separate person or to the army  leaders as a group, would be a worse alternative than its current state.

"Why? A better question is why not. 
You might say transgender surgeries are elective so they should not. But I think most people would consider birth control to be elective and that's is covered under health insurance by law (Obamacare) at izero copayi. 
Think about it, if a boy were born with something wrong with his penis, you'd say health insurance (whether you're in America or in a country with actual universal health care) should pay for it? 
That's what transgender men are. They are boys born with no male genitals. 
I know trans people who want to change genders but they don't have the $$$. So they save and wait. If you want to change your physical gender, I would like America to pay for that via taxes, but we don't have single payer health care, we have Obamacare, so Obamacare should force insurance to cover this, just as it does birth control.

I don't think this would have much financial effect because there are so few transgender people within the population who actually go through with the surgery. I bet this would add pennies to your monthly premium. So why not?

"There's a lot of debate about how some people are ""paid too much"" for what they do. I frequently find that people who think CEOs are paid too much have no issues with how much athletes and movie stars are paid.

CEOs, athletes, and movie star pay are all subject to the same laws of supply and demand. The owners of the movie, owners of the team, and owners of the company, agree to pay the amount.

What's similar among them all are that they often don't last very long. These are high profile people. Mistakes, poor performance, and even bad luck means your contract won't be getting renewed and any chance of future employment can be lost.

These types of talents are what owners try to bring on board in hopes that they will make lots of money for them. To say that an athlete should not be paid so much is the same as saying the owner of the team should not be allowed to spend his money a certain way. I don't see how it is different for shareholders looking to employ a CEO.

At the end of the day, all of these are dictated by supply and demand. No one pays millions for an athlete if he doesn't believe that athlete would be an asset to the team. If someone is willing to pay the amount, there is at the very least, the belief that the amount is worth it. You pay a popular actor a lot because you're receiving the ticket sales of his fan base. You pay a CEO a lot because he knows how to negotiate better deals with suppliers or can provide the vision for the next product.

TLDR - There's no difference between CEO's, athletes, and actors being paid a lot. If you're ok with one, you should be ok with them all.","{'his', 'actors', 'actor', 'he'}"
"I am basing this opinion on several points. 

To begin with, my view is a natural consequence of my personal belief that every human being has a right on living, a principle that is listed in Article 3 and more. 

The death penalty is strictly opposed to this tenet. While some people may agree, that by commiting certain crimes such as child molestion, mass murder, et al. forfeit their basic human rights, this is a highly subjective point of view that cannot be unambiguously established, as opinions regarding this topic vary  between the various religions, cultures and nations.

Another reason why Capital Punishment should be abolished, is that it is not a punishment in real terms, but merely a ""solution"", to satisfy the immediate need for equal retaliation according to the principle of ""an eye for an eye"". By punishing murderers or similar offenders with murder, the judicial system essentially lowers itself to an ethical level akin to that of said offenders. While this is technically a kind of punishment, it is not the one we should advocate, as it conflicts with the moral principles we have determined for ourselves.

Furthermore, the fact that death is a final event - an irreversible one - means, that juridical mistakes have a much bigger consequences. If an innocent is erroneously put under arrest for years, he can still be released and even compensated once his innocence has been proven, but you cannot revive an innocent who was killed for something he did not commit.

Additionally, Capital Punishment is even economically more unfavorable than imprisonment, mainly due to higher defense costs for a death row candidate.

Resting upon these aspects, I hold the firm belief that Capital Punishment is ethically wrong and unjustified, while also being more of an economical burden than imprisonment.

(Note: Because English is not my native language, parts of my reasoning may be wrong or not make any sense. Thank you for your understanding.)

Too much is invested in maintaining the present balance of political and financial power in the country, and incentives are so great to prevent the rise of someone like Sanders to the WH.

"Basically I have some mental issues (mainly anxiety, OCD and trusting people). I realize the issues are irrational but what irritates me is when someone tells me I should ""talk to someone about them""

I'm not sure what talking to someone would do, as from every experience I've had they will just parrot back at me what I already know about the disorder.

Aside from maybe giving me medication, I see absolutely no value in ""talking"" to someone, when I've pretty much analyzed the root of most of my problems.

When it comes to anxiety, OCD and trust, these are all things I'm extremely cautious about. Telling me to be less cautious about a valid threat is like telling me to be less cautious about walking through the ghetto at night.

I can't possibly imagine what benefit a psych professional would give to someone who is aware they are irrational. 

The neurotic precautions I take aren't on the scale of not leaving the house because a meteor might hit, they are legitimate precautions that most normal people admit to me are a valid concern, but that they ""try not to think about what could happen"" and thus don't take precautions.

For example:

-Sleeping in my car instead of a hotel for fear of bed bugs.

-Completely writing off living in apartments as an option for fear of getting bed bugs/cockroaches.

-Throwing away food (as opposed to making a scene or eating it) if I see the food employee handle it with their bare hands, or inadvertently touch the side of the napkin that will grab my pastry with their dirty hands, before picking it up.

-Unscrewing my lightbulbs before I leave my house to confuse potential burglars.

-Taking alternate routes if I see a gravel truck a mile ahead of me on the highway, as opposed to being forced to inevitably pass it and get my car pelted with stone chips.

-Dating, at all. Would not commit to someone unless I was on a desert island where noone else could interfere. Dating in a dynamic world where I am anything less than a top 10% male is too risky, as all it would take is a determined individual with more to offer than myself and an opportunistic time.

-Expiration dates: When in doubt of how long a food item was opened for I throw it away, even if it's a condiment that tends to have a long shelf life. Unknown = toss. I wasted so much money doing this I now exclusively eat out to avoid having to throw food away.


So as you can see I have rational concerns but irrational worry about them. Telling me not to do any of those things is asking me to be more vulnerable to threats with relatively high probability of happening. IT isn't like I'm afraid of meteors and volcano's here... I spend too much time researching things and have become hyper aware.

For example, each one of the things I listed, a person in that profession may also do the same thing I do, for example a pest control professional might also avoid hotels, knowing the high risks.... a car detailer might also avoid highways if he sees a gravel truck, and a food safety professional might also throw food away if he sees a dirty hand touch it...

the problem is because I research everything, I have developed the ""experts precaution"" on just about all of it... and it costs me a lot of time and money, though I don't see what a psych could do other than prescribe me meds or tell me to be more accepting of risk.

" may appear ethnocentric by judging other cultures by my culture's standards, but actually I'm using logical moral reasoning valid for all Humans, because we have so much in common. Suffering, grief, and starvation are universally bad. Personal fulfillment and health are always good. There's nothing wrong with acknowledging what's working and what isn't, even across cultural boundaries. However, I don't support the kind of ethnocentrism that thoughtlessly assumes my own values are the best (aside from the universals I mentioned).

Some cultures are better at promoting the good and minimizing the bad. Norwegians are better at it than Somalis, overall. The two countries are near opposite ends of every ranking of national happiness.

A Nord could criticize a Somali for honor-killing his raped daughter because Nordic morals are more successful at promoting overall wellbeing than Somali morals.

The reasoning the Somali man is likely using is that consent is not a factor in sex, so she is culpable and profoundly sinful. Honor dictates that he protect his family's reputation by killing her. This conforms to his idea of Islam and is the best way to protect the immortal souls of himself and the remaining ""pure"" members of his family.

The Nord would see a misogynist man selfishly protecting his own standing in the community by harming a disenfranchised girl under the dubious pretext of preserving the purity of ""souls,"" the existence of which no reliable evidence supports. What's more, helping oneself by hurting others should be discouraged because the Nords believe it degrades the level of wellbeing in a society, and they would know-- they're near the top of the happiness charts.

Some people practice critical thinking and do their own moral reasoning. Others follow the less mentally demanding path of tradition. The result is that some people develop moral skills that maximize health and happiness and minimize suffering. Better educated nations do better at this. Norway has great education, Somalia has terrible education. Thus some nation's morals end up superior to others.

"On Sunday, Rand Paul spoke  for 10 and a half hours in order to ensure that the Patriot Act, which contains sections used to justify government surveillance, would not be renewed.  While doing this, his campaign was selling ""Filibuster Starter Packs""(https://store.randpaul.com/index.php/filibuster-starter-pack.html) in order to garner support for his presidential bid.  He additionally used parts of his filibuster in a political video made for his campaign.  While I know my opinion that it is important to renew the patriot act is unpopular here on reddit, I think that it is fair that anyone who agrees with the act or not should consider the fact that Paul intentionally stalled debate on the matter, a matter of national security.  While Rand held the floor, shouting the same ideas over and over again in various permutations of the same couple lines about the government committing criminal acts and how American freedom is being violated, no informed debate on the matter could occur.  To prevent debate on a matter of national security like this I believe is already irresponsible, but to then to blatantly use this restriction of informed debate for the sake of promoting his own presidential bid makes it even more irresponsible.  I don't think that it is necessary for one to agree with the provisions of the patriot act (though I do) in order to believe that what Rand Paul did was incredibly irresponsible.

Now, I would anticipate that I will get some responses saying I likely find filibusters an irresponsible practice.  I still have mixed feelings about them on the whole, but I do want to focus on this specific one as I believe that it was entirely irresponsible.  

Finally, This is my first post on this sub, though I've been reading and commenting for some time.  So I just want to say this sub is an awesome community, so Thanks everyone!

"First, I can present as arrogant and self righteous and I am aware of this but do not mean to be. I am black. I have friends of Caucasian and Chinese descent. When I interact with them, the stereo types I have heard about their race is usually reinforced by their own actions. 

I'll get more in depth; i deliver Chinese food in southeast Dallas.  A stereotype of blacks is that we are notoriously poor tippers. I cannot disagree. In the years of my employment, which provides for me and my son surprisingly well, I have learned through direct observation that that stereotype is based in reality. Whites tip me, Hispanics tip me, Asians as well; blacks...?ha! I digress but I hope my point is clear. I approach a known black customers house knowing the chances are that they will not tip me. It minimizes the dissapointment. It is beneficial to me to enter into these interactions using a stereotype to my advantage. Granted, my emotions are not that important but I truly feel better knowing how this interaction is probably going to go, and that's a benefit. Its safe to expect a tip from whited or hispamices, etc. and there's no cautionary warning in the form of a stereotype regarding these races. 


I know that may be a flimsier example but I think it suffices to illustrate my point. If you are going on a date with a white person, assuming they can't dance may and provably will save one from a potentially awkward situation. Knowing, or expecting(due to the stereotype) that a Hispanic might work hard for cheap can and probably does lead to financial benefits for shrewd entrepreneurs.

I have no sources for this its just a gut feeling. I think stereotypes are usually valid and can be used to my benefit. CMV!

"Hello everyone, with all the media coverage lately regrading transgender individuals I find myself uneducated on the particular subject and would love to be enlightened on the topic. I support the rights and henceforth of lesbians, gays, and bisexuals but can't wrap my head around the idea of transgenderism. From a purely medical/biological standpoint, it doesn't seem as if one should be able to claim to be the opposite gender when scientifically they have been classified to be the other. Even with the surgeries and artificial hormone replacements, wouldn't the artificial nature of these changes render the claim illegitimate? From a societal standpoint, obviously the idea of gender identity is one that has, for a majority of human history, been based around a singular core fact - we have two genders, man and woman, and you are either one or the other. Is there more to this perceived truth, or is transgenderism the result of a mental nuance that simply appears now because of the emergence of rights for the LGBT community, but has in fact, always been there?

This post isn't meant to attack/offend/etc. anyone, and again if I seem ignorant on the subject it is only because frankly I am and am only here to be educated. Thanks for any responses that can help me understand.

Edit: Thanks to everyone who's contributed (positively); I've learned a lot from this thread such as gender vs. sex, gender dysphoria, transgender vs. transsexual, etc. I definitely feel I have a better grasp of trans as a whole.

"POTENTIAL SPOILERS for both Witcher 2 and Witcher 3. I've completed Witcher 2 and act 1 of Witcher 3. I'll try and mark them, but I warned you.

For starters: I read an article today that really bothered me. See here.

In summary: a pair of feminists apparently known as the ""Feminist Frequency"" are now throwing stones at Witcher 3. What I don't get is that, as far as I can tell from my non-Feminist masculo-mind, is that the game is almost a perfect representation of what so many people cry out for in regards to video games and breaking the trends of all of Feminism's buzz-words.

The McIntosh guy seems to be going on and on about how Geralt lacks emotion, men need to cry, blah blah blah - so on and so forth. See his Twitter(https://twitter.com/radicalbytes). I have to agree with what Kain says in his article about McIntosh: either he hasn't played the game at all or he's intentionally choosing dialogue options to make Geralt a sociopathic murdering machine - in which case he needs to turn that all-powerful analytic mind of his in on himself. Geralt, despite the fact that Witchers are rumored to be stripped of emotions when undergoing mutations, is an extremely emotional and complex character with strong feelings for each of his companions. Hell, even the other Witchers you encounter throughout the game portray emotions as you explore conversation opportunities with them. I can honestly say I have never played a game that manages to make so many of its characters seem legitimately human. But this guy over here is screaming ""hegemonic masculinity!""

Meanwhile, Sarkeesian is going on and on and on about gendered insults(https://twitter.com/femfreq). My only response to that is: toughen the fuck up. People call me a dick, people call me an asshole, I don't get up in arms about it or take any more offense than if they'd called me a bitch or a cunt. The game is extremely immersive, that's part of the thing that makes it so incredibly popular. Regardless of the monsters and ghouls, the game is set in medieval times and with that comes a certain environment. If anything it's a reminder of how far we've come.

They're cherry picking an otherwise excellent title is such not only because of it's immersive content, but also because it (from my understanding) fulfills so many of the things that I see people in other debates here begging for regarding video games. But here's the thing: look at the feedback on their shit. There's far and beyond more people supporting what they're saying than against it. So wtf?

 I will concede that the main character is a male, and nothing you do can change that. However: there is some very serious character development around Ciri in which you get a feel for her personality. You get to play as her, and you play through her story just about as much as you do Geralt (as far as the main story is concerned). Not only that, she's tremendously more powerful than Geralt is.

 Ciri is not an ""unrealistically gorgeous"" female, unless you're going to try and say that she's portraying women should all go out and get bad-ass scars on their faces in which case I guess I'd have to concede that point. She isn't running around doing back-flips with double D's. She doesn't wear revealing clothing, and she's got the same ""dirty"" look that the rest of the (non-Sorceress) characters in the game do.

 WITCHER 2 SPOILER Speaking of sorceresses: there's a coalition of extremely powerful women who (at the end of Witcher 2) damn near took over the entire Northern Kingdoms with the end-game of taking over the world. Here we have a bunch of bad-ass chicks that no one is walking on top of, until the end at any rate when their plot is exposed and the entire Northern Kingdom begins a crusade against magic, not women.

 MINOR WITCHER 3 SPOILER At the point in the story I'm at now, Ciri is not a sexualized character - at all. The one dialogue I've seen where it was implied things might get sexy... well, let's just say it doesn't. Hell, there's one point where all the females she's surrounded by are in the nude but her ""naughty bits,"" tits included, are still covered which to me says the developers were actively trying to ensure that you, in fact, don't sexualize her.

What am I missing here? Why is Witcher 3 being lumped in with the anti-womyn games like it's the old-fashioned Tomb Raider with Laura Croft's lack of personality and basketball sized boobs? Am I just not looking in the right places to see this point of view? Or is it just that a couple mainstream Feminists are making a big stink over nothing, as it seems?

So, in summary, the Witcher 3 falls more into line with Feminism than most video games that have come out thus far and Feminists should embrace it, not shun it. Change my view.

"I believe that there exists a great market for auto insurance that only insures elite drivers.  Personally, I have never made a claim in the 17+ years that I have been driving and paying auto insurance and I believe that I should be paying a lot less than I am.  If I had the money to invest, I would start an insurance company that requires the following of all policy holders, no exceptions:

1) No less than 10 years of driving experience.  
2) Zero at fault accidents in at least 10 years.

3) Zero claims filed with your previous insurance company in the last 10 years.

4) No moving violations in the last 7 years (eliminates one third of fatalities).

5) No DUI or felony driving convictions, for your lifetime (eliminates one third of fatalities).

http://www.carinsurance.com/Articles/How-many-accidents.aspx?WT.qs_osrc=fxb

I understand that the qualifications are somewhat subjective, but I don't see a fair way to avoid that.  You could say that you are still a very low liability if you have only 1 speeding ticket for 5 mph over the limit 6 years ago, but that opens the door for a guy who has 2 tickets.  You have to draw the line somewhere.

To answer some likely questions: if you are on a policy and do something that causes you to no longer , the claim is paid but your policy is cancelled until you meet the requirements again.  No, you cannot add your teen driver to your policy, no matter how great you think they did in driving school.  Yes, your spouse is listed as an excluded driver if they do not also meet the requirements. All others are listed as excluded drivers.   

I believe that enforcing the above would drive down claims enough that rates could be drastically reduced.  The main people who are opposed to this would be those who are butthurt that they don't qualify.  That's just too bad.  This is a (hypothetical) private company that has the right to refuse service to those who do not meet its qualifications, just as other insurance companies do.

The following is just an observation that I tried to backup with data but I have not found anything.  It does not seem to me that car accidents are evenly distributed.  It seems that some people smash up their car every couple of years and others have never caused such an event.  As such, the requirements are intended to disqualify about 90% of the people on the road today, and offer insurance only to those who have consistently demonstrated a high skill level and good judgement.

I believe many good drivers would flock to this service because they are tired of spending their money on a service they have never needed to use and have a very low probability of using in the future.  This is not a service for everyone, but for those who qualify I think it could add a lot of value.  To CMV, you will have to convince me that this is not a viable business idea.  You will not CMV with responses that state any version of ""I'm a good driver but I don't met X, and I think I'm special and should still be able to be insured thru this company.""  Thanks.

"I think that all humans deserve the same amount of respect, all else being equal. In other words, if I don't know you at all, my respect for you won't change based on your gender, orientation, race, religion, etc (If I do know you, and you give me reason to increase or decrease my respect for you, I will, of course).

I think that referring to people based on their accomplishment is just fine -- being the First Person in Space is a grand title for Yuri Gagarin. But why is he referred to as the first man in space? To me, calling Valentina Tereshkova the First Woman in space simply emphasizes her difference -- she's female -- instead of her accomplishment.

If we're all supposed to treat everyone equally regardless of race, nationality, gender, orientation, religious views, etc; wouldn't referring someone as the first whatever to do something simply remind everyone that the difference is still there, and make it that much more difficult to ignore in the future?

EDIT: My V has been C'd! I see that the social impact of the accomplishment is equally important, and we need to recognize what these people had to go through in order to actually get there! I do think, though, that these types of titles will slowly become irrelevant for future accomplishments, and eventually will be relegated only to the history books.

"A few things to note before a start:

1. I'm not arguing to the contrary against gay marriage. I am for gay marriage as I am for polygamous marriages.

2. I'm not arguing for forced marriage or arranged marriages where several women are forced to marry a single man, like in various religious sects, but the concept of a marriage containing multiple people as a whole.

3. I am as much for polyandrous marriages as I am for polygynous marriages. (i.e. women can have multiple husbands in addition to men having multiple wives.

4. Willing to discuss this legally and ethically in seperate spheres, but let's try not and mix the two together too much, unless absolutely necessary. It is assumed that gay marriage is both legal and ethical for the purpose of this discussion. If you believe gay marriage should be illegal or is unethical, then those arguments have merit towards polygamous marriage as well.

Alrighty, now onto my main points.

1. Polyamarous people deserve the same right to equality, to marry who they love, just like homosexuals, and heterosexuals. Polyamarous relationships are no less moral than homosexual relationships, and relationships between consenting adults should be able to be consummated in marriage.

2. Marriage was not made legal by a popular vote in many places. The only country to legalize it via a popular vote was Ireland a week or so ago, everywhere else had it decided by judges or representatives. In the US, interracial marriage and gay marriage has been ruled as legal by courts, not voted in. Public opinion towards polygamous marriage is irrelevant.

3. When it comes to raising children, one can assume that since having a single parent results in worse-off children, then having a higher amount of parental figures and providers would make for a similar, if not better child-rearing than having one parent, two parents, or two parents of the same sex (all of which are legal). Source 

4. When it comes to insurance, legal proceedings, etc. everything can be easily adjusted to treating additional spouses as additional dependents (as where such institutions are adjusted for additional children). Yes, it is true that the current system does not allow for it, but it can be adjusted. When it comes to division of property, divorce, etc. things will simply be divided by the amount of people participating in the marriage, i.e. if there are three people, everything gets split 33%, or if the other two remain married, it gets split 66%. Prenuptual agreements can take care of anything that may be complicated by this if spouses have different intentions for how things are split. There will be a cap where insurance coverage/tax benefits end, i.e. if you have more than 7 children you stop receiving benefits for any more. For taxes and insurance, children are treated similarly to spouses, and additional spouses shouldn't complicate things out of reason. The specifics as to what the cap will be, how things get split, life and death decisions, etc. can be hammered out by individual states and individual people participating in a marriage, just like in other marriages.

5. Sham marriages containing two people that don't love each other, of the same or different sex are currently legal. Chuck and Larry marriages are currently possible, the only difference in allowing polygamous marriages would be to not allow odd numbers of people to participate in such marriages, rather than being in pairs. The difference here is insignificant.

6. The idea that polyamarous people are treated ""equal"" because everyone is only allowed to marry one spouse is the same type of ""equality"" where everyone is only allowed to marry within their race or sex. This is nonsensical. Everyone being held to the same standard of law does not work when people love people outside of what is socially accepted.

7. Polyamarous relationships aren't any less stable than homosexual relationships or heterosexual relationships. Even if they were, it shouldn't have any weight, as interracial relationships are much less stable than intraracial relationships. To argue that polygamous marriage shouldn't be allowed because of a instability in relationships is also to argue against interracial marriage.

"I recently posted this video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAVufRsalw0) in a thread. I just meant it as a jokey response to someone's comment, but some people took offence to it. Apparently, because the actor playing the character isn't black, that makes this blackface and therefore unacceptable and offensive.

To offer some context, this is from a show called facejacker which is a follow-on from fonejacker. Fonejacker was a show about one man making prank calls and playing characters. You never saw his face. Mostly what you got was the audio from the conversation and an animated still picture representing the character like this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA3zhzT1wDo). So, the blackface character in the video above was developed for fonejacker. It's just meant to be an amusing accent that plays off people's image of a ""Nigerian scammer"". Because he was such a popular character, he was brought back for facejacker. The concept of facejacker was to take some of those characters and turn the actor into them with make-up so he could go out and prank people face to face. So, the character came first. It's meant to be funny and it's meant to play off certain stereotypes people have, but it isn't racist and shouldn't be taken as such.

This is one example of many. I just think that only context and intention of the author can determine if something is racist or not. I also believe that we should be moving towards a world where a black actor can play a white character and a white actor can play a black character and no-one cries racism because racism just isn't an issue anymore. The problem is that this kind of knee-jerk reaction (he used the N-word, he's a racist / he's in blackface, so he's a racist) does nothing to help us achieve that, but in fact holds us back by emphasizing racial differences and causing arguments. 

TL/DR; You shouldn't call things offensive just because they've fulfilled some basic criterion (like use of blackface or the n-word for example), you should actually examine the intentions of the author and the context to determine whether or not something is truly offensive.

"First off, as a male who was circumcised at birth, I am glad that I was circumcised.  Any associated pain does not exist to me because I cannot remember it, in the exact same way that pain associated with other surgical procedures I have had under general anesthesia as an adult does not exist because I cannot remember it.

The WHO currently recommends male circumcision for HIV prevention and ""as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package"".  It is primarily recommended in areas with high incidences of HIV, but given its demonstrated effect at reducing the spread of the virus I prefer to have any added protection possibly available.  I would plan to infer the same protection to any hypothetical children born at this time, especially considering that the complication rates here are significantly lower than in the areas where it is most strongly recommended by the WHO.

Living in the midwest U.S. it is culturally nearly expected, with 70-80% prevalence.  Because of this, many to most potential sexual partners in my area (including myself, as a gay male) prefer the aesthetic of a circumcised penis.  With the research consensus demonstrating no adverse effects on sexual performance, I see no reason to not stick with the cultural norm. 

What may help change my view:

 Scientific studies demonstrating prolonged psychological damage due to infant male circumcision.

 Scientific studies demonstrating that complication rates and severity in the U.S. outweigh potential benefits due to HIV resistance.

 Scientific evidence that circumcised males in the U.S. are demonstrably less satisfied with their sex lives than uncircumcised males.

What will not help change my view:

 ""People should be allowed to chose"".  Parents are wholly responsible for their children's health and well-being until they are capable of making those decisions on their own.  Circumcision complication rates increase dramatically with age.

 ""If everyone stopped doing it, it wouldn't be culturally expected anymore."" Yeah, not going to happen any time soon.  I am talking the choice for parents to circumcise in areas of the U.S. where it is highly prevalent today.

"I think students should be able to test out of any class, at the very least, any of those at the high school level or higher. I don't think it makes any sense to have a student sit through a class to learn things that he can already prove he knows.

 Tests might not grasp everything taught in the class, allowing the student to miss possibly important information.

I'm assuming these class tests would cover everything covered in the course, or at least be designed to determine the student's knowledge well enough.

 There are other things that take place in the course that develop the students skills, not just teach knowledge.

I'm also assuming these tests would make sure that the student has a mastery of the subjects rather than a simple acquaintance.

 What about classes like literature, and the like? Classes where students learn things that are bigger than other classes (Dead Poets Society plug).

"Note: I will use the traditional definition of drugs as anything that can alter ones mental state. This includes pot and alcohol, as well as meth and cocaine. I also intend to mean any religion, not just the few I've picked out in the statements below.

If a person gets a hold of a bad drug, they are most likely to die fairly quickly, as when one OD’s on heroin, cocaine, or meth. Their death will only hurt their own family. There are instances where someone takes a substance and hurts or kills others in the process, such as when they are driving while intoxicated or sees someone as a personal demon who should be killed; but after a few hours the hallucinogenic effects wear off and those who took the drugs see what they’ve done had real life effects and that what they did was bad.

If a person get a hold of an extreme religion, they are most likely going to spread hate for different groups for many years if not decades, as in the case of the KKK, Westboro Baptist, or ISIS. Their religion will hurt and terrorize dozens of families with each action. There are instances where someone takes their religion and hurts and kills others, as when they burn people for witchcraft or for being a homosexual or when she walks outside without covering her head; though even after many years those who are in the religion will almost never see what they did as bad, only wholesome.

Some men and women commit heinous sexual assaults on others while under the influence of various substances and are very heavily prosecuted in a court of law. 

Some priest and clergy commit heinous sexual assaults on others while under the influence and in the name of religion and are rarely if ever prosecuted or excommunicated from the church.

When a parent gives their child a drug, whether it be chemo, alcohol, or a vaccine, some group will most deficiently say that what they did is wrong, even if it isn’t.

When a parent gives their child a religion, whether it be Catholicism, Mormonism, or Islam, almost no one says that what they did is wrong, even if the core believes of that faith are extreme.

"By financial abortion (FA), I mean that men could choose not to be forced to pay for children they do not wish to raise (could only be done pre-birth, ideally pre-conception).

Many people oppose financial abortion. However, it seems to me that it is extremely difficult to oppose financial abortion without using logically inconsistent, and therefore invalid, arguments.

Why are arguments that are logically inconsistent invalid? For example, suppose I stated that it's wrong to eat cows as food since we do not need to kill animals in order to meet our nutritional needs. I then state that it is ok to wear leather jackets. We can see that this doesn't make sense - it is logically inconsistent. So it must then be dismissed, unless I can resolve the inconsistency.

This is different than mere hypocrisy, which does not invalidate an argument. Suppose I said that people should not smoke, because it is bad for your health. I then admit that I smoke a pack a day. My statement is hypocritical, but that is irrelevant since my argument is still just as strong or weak regardless of whether I am a hypocrite or not).

In order to oppose financial abortion while still remaining logically consistent, one must also hold a great deal of other beliefs, which most people do not.

What do I mean? I'll explain:

Suppose I stated that children are entitled to support from its biological parents. Therefore, FA is wrong.

However, those who believe this must also oppose sperm clinics to remain logically consistent. Children born from sperm clinic donations are not entitled to support from their father. But most people have no objection against sperm clinics. Note that under this argument, it doesn't matter if the mother is a multi-millionaire. If a child is obligated to support from its parents, that does not change regardless of the wealth of its mother. 

If we then made the argument that ""the reason children are entitled to support from their parents because most mothers are not rich enough to support it themselves. So it's ok for women to sue sperm clinics if they can support a child on their own."" - then we would have to agree that men should not be forced to pay child support if the mother is rich, in order to remain logically consistent. Yet this belief is not popular.

It also means that you must believe that male rape victims - both boys and men - should be forced to pay child support. After all, they are the biological parent. However, most people do not support this.

This usually leads to an argument along these lines: ""male rape resulting in a kid is quite rare compared to consensual sex resulting in a kid. Only people who consent to sex should be forced to support resulting children.""

However, if you support this argument, then you must also oppose adoption or abandonment, as they currently stand. A woman who adopts out or abandons a child (which was from consensual sex) is not forced to support it.

The common rebuttal to that is something like ""If neither biological parent wishes to raise the child, then it is fine for neither of them to be forced to pay. Adoption means someone else agrees to raise and support the child.""

But wait - didn't we say earlier that a child was entitled to support from its biological parents? If so, then they are entitled to that support whether only one parent wants to abandon responsibility, or both parents do.

Moreover, not all kids given up for adoption are taken in by families, particularly older or non-white ones (in America). Many remain in foster care indefinitely. Therefore, one would have to believe that the parents of children who are not successfully adopted should be obligated to pay for them. But I have never seen anyone put forth this argument.

Another common objection to financial abortion is that without forcing men to pay, we would have to increase welfare to prevent kids from living in poverty. And that should not be done because it would burden the taxpayer.

However, a poor man and woman who have a child would also have this burden. Many people do think that poor men and women should not have children, but most do not think there should be any legal consequences for doing so.

Alternatively, a poor woman is perfectly entitled to have one-night stands, and not tell the father if she becomes pregnant. She may then move to a different city, have the child and go on welfare. 

I do not see anyone claiming that women should not be allowed to do this, even though this is also a burden on taxpayers.

Of course, it is quite possible to have logically consistent arguments against financial abortion. For instance, I could state that financial abortion should not be allowed, because I think that men, as a class, are obligated to give money to women as a class. With that argument, it would be relatively easy to maintain logical consistency with other beliefs. However, that is not a common argument, in my experience.

In order to change my view, I could see two things:

Convincing me that positions such as opposing sperm clinics or agreeing that male rape victims must be forced to pay are widely-held among those who oppose financial abortion. Perhaps some surveys showing that large percentages of people oppose sperm clinics under their current usage, for example.

Providing some reasoning that would make it logically consistent to state (this is just an example) that ""parents are obligated to support their biological children"" and ""it's ok for a woman to use a sperm clinic although the father will not be supporting the child."" This seems quite difficult however.

Note: Please don't give me reasons as to why financial abortion should or should not be allowed. The thread is about the logical consistency of opposing financial abortion with other beliefs, not about whether FA should be allowed or not.","{'men', 'man', 'male', 'boys', 'father'}"
"I'm not sure which sex is the superior one, although I'm sure if someone took the time to tally up all of the positive and negative attributes on each side it could be figured out. One sex must be superior to the other because the sexes have differences that lead to their lives being inarguably better than the other sex because of it. For example, women live longer on average than men which is clearly in favor of women, but men are stronger on average than women, which is clearly in favor of men. While these may cancel out, I find it highly unlikely that after going through every difference, men and women would somehow come to the exact same ""score"".

I don't want this to become a debate about the semantics of the words superior or better because some traits are clearly better than others. Also, this post only applies to humans.

And a person’s morals will be based on that upbringing, But shouldn’t someone vote based on their morals? Their version of right and wrong will be based on what they have read and what they think is morally right.  As for leaving religion out of it that is impossible since for someone religious their sense of morality will be based around that religious law.

"I believe negative reinforcement can teach children to behave better and become better people and is a much more universal method than others that can be applied to any student and work in the end.

While things like talking to the student or denying him attention or other modern ways of 'discipline' may work sometimes, they don't work for every student, (I believe some cases may even make the situation worse). Corporal punishment, on the other hand, works for every student and builds a stronger person, pain and fear being much more powerful motivators than a little 'maybe you shouldn't, Johnny.'

Edit: For kind of a sweeping defense for sake of time, I'll make my last reply for the night up here.

Yes, positive reinforcement is also important, but without any kind of real punishment then students who do nothing at all are neither punished nor rewarded, which means that most kids would end up there because it requires no effort, so kids don't try to do anything.

Also, corporal punishment was not put there to reduce crime, its to ensure students are punished for bad actions so that they do not happen at school again. Beyond that, it's up to parents to raise their kids correctly.

"I know this is a very controversial subject, and many people disagree with me, and I have to admit, I am not the perfect judge for this.

A little background on me, just because you should know. First, I consider myself conservative/republican and I am also under 18, so I can't vote. I also live in the US but I think this applies to most countries.

So, I don't think everyone should be given the right to vote. The average person I have found does not know about economics, politics, and policies to make an educated vote.

I see people all the time saying stupid stuff on facebook about something about politics and they really don't know what they are talking about.

In school, you may take one or two economic classes, but that is definitely not enough to make enough of an educated vote. I don't know, because I don't know what I don't know but I feel that the economy is much more complicated than what could be covered in that time.

Something that bothers me a lot is when people make opinions over something they are not educated about. I think we should let the experts make decisions, because they are smarter and more knowledgeable in that subject than the average person. So people, not knowing what the experts say, will go in and vote over something they don't know hardly anything about. Unless you know virtually all the facts about something, you are not educated enough to make decisions about it if there are people do know all of it.

And frankly, you average Joe did not go to school for years and years to study political policies and their effectiveness. Yet he has a vote on what is going on, and that really bothers me. And honestly, I am in that same bout. Maybe it changes when I can vote, but it does not seem like that when I look at older people I know.

Is part of my argument possibly flawed because right now we have a democratic government, and I am republican? Maybe. But I think I can recognize the same problem even if I had the ""upper hand"". I know reddit is generally very democratic, so please don't make this about that.

I would honestly would like someone to change my view.

"The times where one guy was working in his basement and made some groundbreaking discoveries are over. Nowadays research often requires a large number of people and collaborations. The group leader is instrumental in coordinating the research, but he rarely does the experiments himself. 
It would therefore be only fair to include all people that actually worked on the project in the Nobel Prize.

In addition to that, I believe that Nobel Prizes often do not reflect the body of knowledge that is necessary to lead to a given discovery. Or in other words, there are lots of groups that go unnoticed, but without which the discovery would have been impossible.

TL;DR: The Nobel Prize is a relic of the past because it doesn't reflect how team-focused, highly collaborative, cumulative and interdisciplinary science has become.

Alright, it seems like in this world there are only the good things and the bad things, the black and white, and though I believe the world is not black and white and there is a grey area in between, what is that grey area? I haven't been able to figure it out like, for example: a man steals food from a shop because he doesn't have enough money and he needs to feed his kids, then he gets caught and taken to prison. Though he did something ""bad"" (stealing) for a ""good"" cause (feed his children), he still did something bad therefore he gets a punishment. Where's the grey in that? I don't know.

That's one of my confusions, the grey between the black and white. To be clear, I'm not bigoted or religious and I understand there are diferent types of good and different types of bad depending on your context, where you live.

The other thing I'm confused about and that is fairly linked to the first one is if there's something besides ""the good"" and ""the bad"". I personaly live by trying to do the good but I also think that the bad is necesary until a certain degree.

"It is my belief that the great majority of average people's opinions about economic policies are predicated on a central false assumption: that the wealth of the ""rich"" provides only a private benefit to the ""rich"" themselves. Or, if people recall the basic lesson of economics that, in a free economy, wealth is not zero-sum, they still dramatically underestimate the degree to which the wealth of the ""rich"" benefits not just the ""rich"" but everyone in society.

The fact that people believe this can be seen in virtually any reddit thread on political-economic debates. There are the usual cursory dismissals of so-called ""trickle-down economics"" (itself a pejorative term for supply-side economics). There is the condemnation of income inequality and the call for redistribution. There are the constant demands for more government intervention into the economy and allegations that the cause of our economic and political troubles is lobbying by corporations and the ""rich"" for policies that benefit only their class interest.

There are two separate lines of argument here: the economic and the political. The economic argument is that the rich are ""hoarding"" too much wealth, which is no longer finding its way to the common man. The political argument is that the lobbying of the rich is the cause of governmental ""cronyism"" and special-interest politics. I think the political argument has more of a kernel of truth than the economic, but they are both utterly off-base.

The Economic Argument

Why is it somewhat natural for the naive person to think that the wealth of the rich benefits only the rich? It's because the average person thinks about where the great majority of his own wealth lies: in consumption goods. If I've got food in my refrigerator, you can't eat it. If I've got a car in my driveway, you can't drive it. If I've got a bed in my house, you can't sleep on it. Consumption goods provide a private, exclusive benefit which only one person (and perhaps his friends and relatives) can enjoy.

But the wealth of the rich does not consist exclusively—or even predominately—in ever-larger piles of caviar and champagne. If it did, then it really would just be wasteful ""hoarding"", and calls to stop it would be rational. On the contrary, however, the wealth of the rich consists predominately in capital goods and in claims to wealth such as bank deposits, stocks, and bonds, which are claims on wealth loaned out almost exclusively to businesses for the carrying-on of production.

The fundamental point to realize is that capital goods—as with productive spending in general—provide no special benefit to their owner in their capacity as means of production. As means of production, they provide a general benefit to everyone. The only special or private benefit derived from means of production is the ability of their owner to exchange their proceeds for consumption goods, instead of reinvesting the profits into additional capital goods.

For example, does the ice-cream man's truck provide him a private benefit? No: it benefits all the children who are willing and able to buy ice cream from him. Neither does the gas with which he fills the truck or the additional ice cream he buys to restock his inventory provide him a private benefit. The only private benefit comes insofar as he decides to sell the truck or use the profits not to buy more gas and ice cream, but to buy consumption goods for himself.

The same goes, on a larger scale, for a company like Toyota. Do Toyota's factories only benefit the shareholders of Toyota? Obviously not. They benefit everyone who is willing and able to buy a Toyota, by making those cars available to him at a lesser cost. The only private benefit to the shareholders comes insofar as they decide to use their dividends not to buy more stock, but to spend them on consumption goods for themselves.

From the opposite direction, it is necessary to address the ""broken window fallacy"", which is extraordinarily common when dealing with questions like this. Many people, apparently having taken the lesson that wealth is not zero-sum too far, think that consumption provides a general benefit to society—and therefore that we should encourage as much of it as possible. This is not the case.

For example, take the purchase of a Ferrari, which is a consumption good. The naive view is that this ""creates jobs"" and is therefore good for the economy. The fact is, however, that the Ferrari represents, from the point of view of society, the consumption of wealth. In other words, it is the destruction of wealth. Yes, it transfers some wealth from the buyer to the Ferrari company and its employees, but it is a net loss. The engineering talent and factories which made the Ferrari could instead have been allocated toward the production of industrial machines and trucks which contribute to further production.

Now, this is not to say that we ought to ban Ferraris or other forms of consumption spending by the rich. They are necessary as an incentive to produce, and innovation in the form of toys for the rich often results in technologies that have wider application. But there is no need to ""increase demand"" or ""stimulate consumption"": we already have enough needs in the world; what we need is more supply, more ability to produce.

The connection to this to the point about the general benefit of the wealth of the rich is: contrary to most people's assumptions about ""trickle-down economics"", the rich do not benefit society insofar as they frivolously spend or give away their fortunes. (I really do think this is what many people think: that tax cuts for the rich are supposed to be good because it will encourage them to be more charitable or maybe buy a few new Ferraris.) Rather, the more parsimonious and Scrooge-like a rich person is—the less he spends on personal consumption and the more he saves and invests into productive enterprises—the greater does his fortune benefit society.

And that's the essential point: the world's richest people may control a large share of the total wealth, but they do not spend nearly as much of that wealth on consumption as does the average person. Now, if the goal of leftist movements were to decrease the amount the rich spend on consumption and make them save and invest more, it would at least be understandable (if unwise). But the desire to increase corporate and inheritance taxes or, worse, have a capital tax could not be more counter-productive. These represent the taxing of wealth which goes almost exclusively toward production and which therefore provides a general benefit to everyone.

The Political Argument

I will deal with this much more succinctly, since it is less complex. It is observed that our political system grants all kinds of special favors to connected companies, such as corn, sugar, and ethanol subsidies. And reddit is always blowing up over the Trans-Pacific Partnership and similar deals which grant special protections and favors to certain companies.

But do such deals exist because of the lobbying of the rich? Absolutely not, when you turn to the question of the fundamental causes. No company could ever stand up and say that, purely out of naked greed for the unearned, they demand that the American people subsidize them. They come in on the grounds the socialists and interventionists have already prepared for them: that the government has to step in and intervene in the economy for the good of society. They merely argue that the good of society is achieved by interventions on their behalf.

Now, of course, each individual voter cannot take the time and effort to lobby for the general interest, as opposed to the special interest of a cronyist company. There is the familiar problem of concentrated gains by the special interest and diffused costs of the general interest.

The weapon of the individual voter is the principle of laissez-faire: that he will not tolerate any intervention in any case, and that he will vote out any politician who votes for such an intervention. But it is precisely this weapon which the dominance of interventionist economic ideology takes out of his hands.

This is all to say: cronyism does not exist as the product of lobbying by the rich for their class interest. It exists because the average voter believes in the philosophy of the mixed economy and the welfare-regulatory state. Cronyism is simply the inevitable consequence of the concentration of economic power in the hands of the state. If one wants to stop money going into politics, one must take away the power of politics to control the flow of money.

TL;DR: Everyone benefits from the wealth of the rich, insofar as they spend it on production. The cause of political cronyism is not wealth inequality but the concentration of economic power in the hands of the state.

"Hello CMV!

First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on this later). This has potentially shaped my ideas on the matter but I thought I'd throw it out there. Please don't judge me on my politics but on the content of the CMV.
I believe that in a free society people have the right to decide whether they should keep a baby or not, women have the right to abort or raise a child. However I believe that men deserve the same right after sex with regards to the child (it takes two to tango). If a mother decides to keep the child then the father deserves the right to accept, or opt out of, fatherhood including all of the repercussions and payments that could be associated with such.

I understand that the state assumes the right of the child  the right of the parent, however I believe strongly that the father has the right to continue to live his life without sinking payments into a child which was optionally chosen. If a man decides he does not want to keep the child then he has the right to refrain from supporting it throughout its life.

Or on the opposite, if a mother is given the option to keep a child, willingly knowing the father does not want to, then she is accepting the responsibility of raising a child by herself, as she has no right to enforce payments on a consenting man who did not wish to have a child.
Obviously this excludes rape and all other implications, this is only within consensual sex.

TL;DR: Men deserve the right to decline fatherhood, and refuse payments for a child they did not wish to claim responsibility for, in a consensual Pro-Choice environment.

EDIT: Slight confusion/comments regarding abortion, I believe that it is solely the woman's responsibility as to whether she should abort or not, it is her ""pro choice"", however fathers have the right to ""opt out"" of fatherhood, or responsibility for that child should the mother keep it.
EDIT2: This is going pretty well, some good discussions. As suggested another way to put this would be 'Committing to sex is not committing to parenthood"". 
TheScamr worded this nicely:
Right now a woman cannot be compelled to be a mother, either financially, custodially or emotionally due to abortion or adoption. Pro choice advocates say when a woman consents to sex she is not consenting to motherhood. OP is asking whether men should also be free such compulsion and the same condition : consent to sex is not consent to fatherhood, either financially, custodially or emotionally.

EDIT3: This has sparked a really nice and balanced discussion, so thank you CMV. It's a controversial topic because while Men should have the same rights as Women, the rights of the child seem to take over that of the father, but not the mother. I think /u/Billy90 put forward the best argument against this.

"A couple of quick notes: I am going to use the term ""believe in evolution"" simply for convenience. Evolutionary theory is generally not considered something that you believe in, but since some Christians deny evolutionary theory they effectively don't believe in it. Also, I am going to be using Christianity as my reference religion, but other Abrahamic religions that contain the genesis story are applicable as well.



The theory of evolution that gives an explanation as to our origins I believe is not compatible with Christianity. You cannot believe in evolution as well as the Christian genesis story because they directly contradict each other. The Christian genesis story states that god created man in his current form, while evolutionary theory explains that life took millions of years to evolve and that our species is descended from a common ancestor with the other primates.

If you are a Christian who believes in evolution as opposed to the genesis story and claim that the Christian genesis is just a metaphor, you open the door for the entire rest of the bible to be just a metaphor as well. Beyond that, if you claim that Christian genesis is just a metaphor because it isn't actually true in a literal sense, then you can further extend that the entire bible isn't true in a literal sense.

If someone were to claim that only the genesis story is a metaphor but the rest is literally true, then that person has effectively filtered the bible themselves. For a person to pick and choose what is real and what is not in a sacred book is to not hold the book sacred. Finally, for a person to not hold the bible sacred is to not be a Christian. Evolutionary theory and Christianity are not compatible. CMV!

"So, I've been studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Alabama for a little over a year. I am a sophomore by hours, but this is my third semester.

Things aren't going as well as I expected. I passed Calculus 1 by the skin of my teeth, and got a D- in Calculus 2, resulting in me being stuck here for a summer semester. 

As far as career goals, I want to go firearms industry, but I have some specifics. I don't want a desk job. Flying a cubicle is my nightmare. I want to have a product. I like hands on work, with a physical result. I hate theory.

I have always been fascinated by machining(look at /r/machiningporn, every link is purple for me) and I've grown to love watching the 3d printers at UA.

In that light, I fear that ME won't put me where I want to be. Looking for co-ops and internships for this summer(before I bombed calc), everything was for a desk job. I would've either been an R&amp;D researcher, or working with Solidworks in a cubicle. I don't want to get shoehorned into an air conditioned job and be unable to get my hands dirty.

I feel like I'd be better served by transferring to a community college and getting a Certificate in Machine Tool Technologies and becoming a machinist, or going for a job in the security industry.

"Crossposted from a comment on /r/skeptic

I've read David Fitzgerald, some of Richard Carrier, and the criticisms of both and it seems to me that there is a lot of vitriol on both sides. The mythicists take umbrage at being dismissed as amateurs and dabblers and vociferously defend their hypotheses, the historicists take umbrage at the strenuous attacks, and it all gets very torrid very quickly, and becomes very difficult to actually analyze the actual strength of the arguments.

So, as a skeptic, I'm sufficiently intrigued by the Mythicist arguments to profess agnosticism as to the Historical Jesus, for the following reasons:

 There are no extrabiblical attestations of any significant event from the life of Jesus. On the contrary, events such as the slaughter of the innocents, the census of all the Empire are clearly fictitious, and multiple miracles, the triumphal entry to Jerusalem, and multiple events surrounding the crucifixion are absent from all historical records when there's a reasonable chance that some account of them would have survived, had they occurred at all.
  The synoptic problem indicates that we are working from at most one source that even approaches being primary, and even that most likely written much later, anonymously, and as hagiography rather than history.
  Well into the third century, pagan sources mostly recount the existence of Christians and document the claims of Christians. This is at best hearsay.
 attempts to reconstruct the ""real"" historical Jesus are invariably unprovable and contradictory with one another--there is no consensus.
 While the vast bulk of NT scholarship presumes an historical Jesus, the ""scholarly consensus"" should be given less weight since for centuries, such research has been largely a devotional undertaking. Jesus mythicism is very nearly literally heretical, as well as figuratively. At least sufficiently that it deserves consideration even though a strong consensus exists that contradicts it.


So, we accept the historical reality of many persons throughout ancient history based on much less proof than gospels and various other pagan mentions. So maybe there was an itinerant sage named Yeshua who ran around, gathered a minor following, and was executed for sedition. But the problems above mean A) we know nothing about him and B) almost everything written about him is unknowable or outright fictitious.


I look at it as the difference between ""Abraham Lincoln"" and ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter."" Notwithstanding that there is an historical person that was the basis, the hero version is a myth.

"While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously ""earning"" the respect of less experienced and established people completely ludicrous. It should be the other way around, if only for practical reasons (the respect of older people tend to be far more valuable). Now, I'm in no way denying that younger folks have valid and interesting contribution to make. I think a fresh perspective coupled with energy and enthusiasm can be an exceptional driving force. Nor am I denying that older folks can be complete assholes because their certainly can. 

However, I could never bring myself to expect older, more experience and better established people to prove themselves to me. Neither can I see a reason to prove myself to younger people today. I expect respect the same way my father or professors did. Not veneration, mind you, but simple deference you'd ought to show to someone that lived twice the time you did. As such, they are not your peers. 

Simply put, I find this phrase (""respect is earned, not given"") is most often used pompously by younger people to undermine established individuals or to deny respect to their elders in spite of a good reason. To my eye, this attitude is the product of four big misconceptions: 

1) Older people demand respect because of their age and age by itself isn't worthy of respect. I do agree that age by itself isn't a quality worthy of respect, but I don't think older folks demand respect in virtue of their age alone either. Experience, I believe, is what you ought to respect in even the humblest of persons. It's not a stretch to assume they've seen a lot more go by and might have a different perspective on life.

2) Showing respect and deference to others cost me something. Respect is free. This stems from a lack of humility. It completely free to respect someone. The only thing holding people back is their ego. Of course you feel invincible at sixteen, but most people passed their teenage years tend to cringe a bit thinking back on their younger self. I know I did.

3) I know these people are whether or not they're deserving of my respect. Assuming anything worthy of respect about someone is readily available is a common mistake. Relating to the second point, what's the price of respecting someone by default ? Worst case scenario, you change your mind later on. Best case scenario, you've done the right thing. 

4) You need to prove yourself. False. Plenty of people ""proved themselves"" already and they shouldn't need to do it again. For instance, people get to positions of power and prestige for a reason. Getting a PhD isn't a walk in the park. Chances are they've been judged by better people than you already. I do understand their reluctance to jump through hoops again to ""earn respect"". 

As such, I think one would be better served by the idea that ""respect can be lost"" rather than ""respect should be earned"". CMV.

"Let me be clear, I am not against the use of self defense by police officers, or anyone, just the idea that the laws do not apply equally. 

This is in direct response to the recent clearing of Michael Brelo of the Cleveland Police Department. In 2012 Brelo was part of a chase that ended with over 130 rounds shot into two unarmed suspects. Brelo fired continued to reload his weapon, climb on the care, and fire another 15 rounds in the car, after other officers had already stopped firing. The judge ruling over the case cleared him of charges using a baseball analogy and saying it was impossible to prove his bullets were the fatal shots. Although this is true, the use of force was excessive and he was still, nonetheless, a party to this grotesque undertaking of ""justice"". 

This case highlights that police can operate according to a separate set of laws. If I was with a person who fired one shot into a person and killed them, despite clear evidence I did not shoot the fatal shot, I would likely still be charged with murder, at the very least accessory (or an equivalent charge) to the murder. Even in a case of clear self defense, one is almost certain to face criminal charges, especially when they continue to use force after the threat has been eliminated and they are in no clear danger. For example, If me and three friends fired 140 rounds into a home invader you can be certain we would all be in jail. Though it would be close to impossible to prove who's shots were fatal, we were all participants, and we would still face severe legal consequences.

If we as a society accept the idea that people are justified in using lethal force in self defense, it should not be also accepted that certain people, because of their job, are able to follow a different set of guidelines. 

So Reddit, in order to help me deal with my anger at the moment, I hope you can convince me that in a nation where ""no man is above the law"" which prides itself on the idea of ""liberty and justice for all"" that some people, because of their job, should be allowed to be ""more equal than others.""

"If God does exist, it seems like He is rather hidden. While some claim to have received revelation, are able to communicate, and know His will, many feel left out of any type of relationship with Him that would make God ""real"" to them. Moreover, when one observes nature and the larger universe, it is hard to see any immediately discernible divine fingerprints that would necessarily point to God. If God exists, it's as if God purposefully hid Himself from His creation, yet, in religions like Christianity and Islam, the non-believer is met with eternal torment for not believing. Because God made it so hard to believe, it's His fault if people don't acknowledge Him, not our's.

"Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I either a) I don't know b) I don't like or c) I'm not friends with.

Except I'm getting a lot of crap because my friends in relationships (I'm single) want to bring their partners who all fall into one of the three above categories. Why should I host people that I don't want to, and who, chances are, don't want to be there anyway?

"I have a debate coming up, and this is the stance I took, but I want to try and see how my opponent can make an argument. Shakespeare made nearly 3,000 words, and most of them have allowed society to become a more expressive and open world, as most dealt with emotions and finding a better way of expressing them. Genghis Khan's impact started and ended with military success. His vast empire fragmented after his death and three of those four fragments had been toppled or reclaimed within a hundred years. Shakespeare introduced so many new concepts to the English language, and his play Julius Caesar inspired the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. I can see that both had an immense impact, but I want to see how Genghis Khan's impact spread farther than that of military.",{'his'}

"I am not here to make an exhaustive (and certainly biased) list of what I believe is wrong with society/culture (specifically in America, where I live), but to suggest that all the issues could be moderated (if not necessarily solved) by establishing new attitudes and behaviors in public spaces and around strangers. It seems that my generation (recently dubbed, by some, the Oregon Trail Generation, existing between Gen-X and Millennials) was the first to be raised with explicit ""stranger danger"" warnings and programs like DARE, latchkey centers, etc. Since then, the stigma against strangers has only increased and our default attitude turned closer to fear and suspicion.

It would take a long time to dissect the various causes for this notable shift but at least some are clear: Modern media more constantly and sensationally depicts the negative potentials (often real, but sometimes illusory). The rapid growth of the internet and technology has given negative individuals access to our private lives and information (think 419 and phishing scams). A more connected and globalized society has shown us a greater number of negative outcomes (even when those numbers do not reflect a higher percentage or likelihood).

I'm certainly not blaming technology for this, as the way we use it exists in a complex cycle of innate habits/desires, the capability of the technology, and a reinforcing feedback loop. Many of the issues are, however, exacerbated by technology because it gives us the ease to disseminate fear-based messages (which are naturally stronger than positive messages) and provides us with a secluded alternative to the public sphere. We can easily find people who agree with us, information that fulfills our search, and interactions that provide some positive stimulus without ever having to interact with strangers.

That said, the insular world we have created puts incredible distance between individuals even as it purports to bring us closer together. While it is wonderful that a person can find a community that shares and validates their unique interests, we are relieved of the burden of having to consider and integrate difference. Further, these habits have not only stratified society economically but subdivided it in all directions. For all the openness of the modern world, we are actually strengthening in-groups by creating social networks and dating sites that cater to race, religion, profession, etc. (I've been looking for research to support this statement, but precious little has been done.)

As I see it, nearly all of these issues would be alleviated by reinstating the public sphere as a place for interaction between strangers. I'm not saying you should talk to every person you see out and about and we definitely need to educate vulnerable groups/individuals on keeping safe (and have a police force capable of adequately and appropriately handling the situation). We could begin simply by discussing the arts when encountered in a public setting (ask a stranger what they thought of a movie instead of just your friends) and discussing news in public forums (why can't people in Boston Common have a conversation about the recent trial?). We should be more open to finding all kinds of relationships randomly, whether on the subway or in the grocery store. 

Obviously, there will be lots of discomfort and inconvenience. You shouldn't talk to everyone, all the time, and it will take each individual an amount of trial and error to gauge what is and isn't appropriate. Still, the general outcome seems to be only positive. For most of the us, the worst outcome is encountering more annoying people, but I actually think ""wait til you hear about this guy I talked to at the gas station"" is more interesting than ""I went to the gas station and listened to this podcast that confirmed what I was already thinking."" We would also be afforded new (that is, old) ways of dealing with issues that arise from online dating and MRA/SJW/etc. communities.

Many people will chalk my attitude up to a rural midwest upbringing as a white male. No, I did not grow up in an area where gangs, drugs, etc. were likely encountered on any sort of regular basis; no, I was not at risk of racial or sexual harassment and related violence. I am, though, familiar with those experiences second-hand (my university had students from 35 states and 42 countries, so I was exposed to an extensive array of different cultures/attitudes/experiences) and actually believe my solution may alleviate them to some extent. A portion of perpetrators (admittedly the ones likely to do the least damage) may change their attitude and behavior because of their increased interactions with others. The worst offenders are likely to attempt/commit their actions regardless. Potential victims may actually gain allies and confidence from increased interaction (one specific ex: women who become comfortable approaching and speaking with men in public are more likely to find men who don't just want sex/dating and the women will demonstrate that they interesting, complex, equal people rather than just joining online groups intent on telling us they are interesting, complex, equal people).

Am I really miscalculating the ratio of benefit/danger? Is there some insurmountable barrier to public interaction I'm not considering? Is this happening more often than I realize but just not in my area?

" Would you go to Enterprise and rent a car for 24 months?  That's very similar to what a lease is.

1. Suze Orman, very rich lady and personal finance guru, hates car leases in all situations.  If anyone ever brings up the topic of leasing a car, she just gives them a Suze Smackdown. 

2. People lease cars so they can afford to drive something they cannot buy. ""You're spending money you don't have to impress people you don't know,"" Suze says. You should go to a used car lot and find something you can own for the same payment as what you would lease. It might not be that hard, the first owner took a 20-30% hit in value as soon as he took ownership. You might find the car 2 or 3 years old and you can buy with the same money. 

3. When you look at the details, it just doesn't add up to a good deal. You have to come up with a large down payment, pay monthly, and at the end of it all, you own nothing. To re up your lease, they expect another large down payment for a car you already have. Their are milage restrictions. 
Once I knew a guy who lived in Detroit and wanted to go to Chicago for the weekend, but was afraid to drive his car because he calculated that his daily commute was going to put him very close to or slightly beyond the mileage limit by lease end. 
You're paying monthly for a car that you can't drive whenever you want because they're going to charge you $.25 per mile over the limit. If you go 3000 miles over (which could happen in one road trip) that's $750 you have to pay just to give the car back.  Oh and you're also paying through the nose for any dent, ding, bump, stain or scratch in the car. 



Unless it's a company providing a company car for business purposes. Your employer isn't in the business of owning, servicing and managing vehicles for the long term so a lease makes sense for them. They dont have time to sell a car when they're done with it, or deal with ownership. All the drawbacks of leasing such as mileage fees, they probably just pass that on to employee driving it.

It even seems in every online confession, it's a man, young man, teenage boy, etc... who seems to have come to a realization that he is sexually interested in prepubescent children AKA pedophilia.

That is my intuitive understanding of the phenomena.

"It's more complicated than I could put in a title. I mean in specific situations. I saw a post describing a couple that had a baby together and their journey. The woman had met her now-husband after having slept with a different man. She found out she was pregnant from that encounter, the couple married and the husband treats the baby as if it were his biologically. There were so many butthurt comments asking if the couple had ever told the biological father about the baby, asking if he had a say in the matter, etc. The mother actually had told the bio dad that she had gotten pregnant, apparently he wasn't a great person. What I don't understand is why being biologically related entitles a person to a child's life. If the argument is ""You did it, your responsibility"", there shouldn't be a problem because there's already a father willing to take the responsibility. I'm not talking about sperm donors, because it goes with being a donor that your involvement includes sperm and nothing else. I mean, if the man had wanted children, there are a lot of ways he could have them- naturally, adopting, surrogates, etc. He didn't have sex with the woman with the intention of having a baby, so why should he be considered as anything but a genetic relative? If I sneezed on a stranger and found out a year later they had somehow had a baby from my sneeze cells, what right would I have to get angry and demand involvement and power over decisions in its life? The thing that's most confusing is that the people getting angry over biological rights are mostly people without religious or supernatural beliefs, so why are they under the impression that sharing DNA creates an emotional bond? I understand there are holes in my stance, and I have nothing against biological parents or any kind of surrogacy, step parent, foster situation. I just genuinely don't understand what reason people have for believing this way.

Afterthought- Perhaps a clearer title would be ""Being biologically related shouldn't grant any parental or family rights/involvement. As far as I know, I can't edit the title.

"I was first exposed to the universe by watching season 1 and 2 of the show. I really liked them and purchased the A Song of Ice and Fire books and loved them even more. Now, when I watch the new episodes or go back and watch those ones I initially liked it feels different. 

 The show now seems like a rookie film students first attempt at portraying the book. The acting, budget, and sets all seem fine. Things like staging, dialogue, character's appearances and the plot's movements seem very obvious and amateurish. 


At first I played it off with rationale like, they have budget issues, or it's just harder to portray these complex scenes on television, or that they needed to shorten the storyline to fit it in a ten season show.  Now I am starting to feel like the show's creators are really just amateurs. They are using the ""best"" books in the last two decades so of course the show is popular. But if someone without their rapey suckage had control, could it be that much better?

Please change my view so I can enjoy the show again. 

I think to accomplish this someone has to either just absolutely school me on film knowledge or make me feel good about the fact that they didn't have a choice for toning basically everything down. Maybe I'm asking too much, if so I apologize.

Translations of my words for clarity.

Rapey suckage - using sexual violence in ways that seem to be more geared towards shocking the audience than furthering the plot. I'm actually thinking more of the rape scenes for Dany and Cersi.

Staging - there is no subtly to the character's positioning in frames. As someone who is only a casual film observer I prefer a show like Breaking Bad where I have to watch it a second time to finally be able to see the importance of things like a character's positioning on camera. GOT seems amateurish when compared.

Dialouge - too many corny phrasings and catch phrases (especially when they use modern idioms). I am currently trying to find a script online so I don't have to transcribe scenes to give you examples. They also do a poor job introducing characters and have to make up for it by having character's say their own names all the time

Character's Appearance - Why can't people have the long hair and beards they are supposed to? Legolas had hair down to his waist and he was still a sex symbol. I know Tyrion can't really have his nose chopped off but their first casting or Daario left my head spinning.

Plot's Movement - Given that they are cutting half of the books out there shouldn't be so many complaints out of non-book readers that the show is boring. Or is the general public just that impatient?

Edit 3 - added a question mark

Edit 4 - Maybe this context will help someone to see another angle to change my view to. I have a cousin who watched the show and read all the books who insists the show is better than the books but never gives me reasons. What could his argument possibly be?

"I have this opinion for a while now. I feel that Reddit is slowly becoming a place not for thoughtful comments or discussion, but rather a website for obtaining worthless internet points with unoriginal content. Even without considering submissions, I have found the comment sections to be very frustrating. I know that Reddit (occasionally, and often jokingly) acknowledges the ""hive mind."" However, this seems more as a means of allowing the user to seem not a part of the hive mind and therefore unique, rather than actually criticizing it and attempting to fix the problem. 

For instance, on a recent post pertaining to the Columbia rape ordeal with the girl carrying her mattress around, the link directed to an article with pictures of posters around the university claiming the girl is lying. There was no evidence or even speculation in the article that said she was/wasn't lying. However, in the comment section for the post, almost every single comment was able how terrible the ""liar"" was and how she deserved it. I immediately thought her claim was proven false, as everyone was so adamant. A quick google check did not confirm anything, except that there is not enough evidence. I did not even bother to comment explaining this, as previous commenters who deviated away from the ""witch-hunt"" were downvoted to oblivion. I am not making a comment on the actual event. As there is no evidence, I feel that I cannot assert that she was or wasn't raped. I know that the concept of false-rape accusations against males comes up quite frequently on Reddit. I completely agree that these claims can seriously hurt and damage an individual's social reputation and mental health. I don't have a problem with that. It just seems that Reddit has become infatuated with this concept and is making claims without any evidence; which is a bit hypocritical given the situation. Anyone who dares to voice their opposing opinion is immediately drowned out.

I realize that not all of Reddit is like this. And of course, I will admit that I have been caught in the moment and contributed to some degree. However, I feel that a large portion is caught up in the hive mind and is not even aware of the issue. Please change my view. Thank you.

"My girlfriend's roommate is a Kindergarten teacher in a very large US City who came home practically sobbing because of one of the kids in her class. The kid's mother insists he doesn't act up at home, but the teacher has called her multiple times about her son's behavior. She can't take away recess from kids. She can only send them to the office for 20 minutes at a time. She's not allowed to take pictures or videos of the kids (but she showed us pictures/videos of the kid that day breaking into drawers, throwing stuff, yelling, rolling up carpets, etc). Attempts to discuss the kid with admins are shrugged off. The teacher is very upset because the other kids have complained that they can't learn and some are beginning to follow suit of the shitty kid. 

I know this is one example, but her school isn't even among the worst, and it isn't as if teachers inability to control students, despite their wishes to, is surprising. We've all heard about terrible parents, helicopters, complaining about grades etc.

I've had the fortune of going to private schools my entire life (though perhaps that is more due to growing up in one of the worst public school districts in the country). One of the effects of that is that they could discipline you as they saw fit. If you acted shitty, you missed recess, had to call your parents, had to write on the chalkboard, had to stay in the office, got yelled at, etc. Public schools, of course, are another matter and it seems like teachers, the very people entrusted with educating the future, are powerless to do their jobs properly.

"Under Sander's plan, the Federal and State Governments would cover the cost of tuition at public universities. I worry that the economic-educational landscape of the country can't support this concept. 

Sanders makes reference to Northern European countries when discussing his plan, noting how college education there is free (or close). While this is true, it fails to mention that admissions in those schools is extremely competitive. Meaning only the best students attend college and only the best of the best attend graduate school. The result is those with a college education are somewhat rare. This is fine because their high school (and vocational) system make it possible to be economically successful without college. 

Here in the US a BS degree is rapidly becoming what a high school diploma was to previous generations, the basic level of education. Anyone with a halfway decent high school GPA can go to college in the US. If money (or a willingness to take on debt) is no longer a way to ""Gate Keep"", lower tier public Universities will be forced to drastically raise standards or close their doors (such as where I went, East Carolina University). This will make getting a BS degree must more difficult (especially for those coming from a failing public school district). The result will be less with a college education and therefore less qualified workers for high tech jobs. 

Unless we make a High School diploma valuable by itself again, free college is doomed to fail.

"First I think I should make all the clarifications I can.  By ""true Christian,"" I mean someone that does their absolute best to live by the teachings of Jesus Christ.  A ""true Christian"" actively analyzes his or her own behavior and actively attempts to better themselves based on Jesus's teachings.  And by ""behavior,"" I specifically refer to relationships with others, social interactions, lifestyle, and actions over words. 

By ""support the United States,""  I want to refer specifically to U.S. foreign policy and action, specifically the current/recent wars in the middle east.  Also think about matters such as:

-support of the state of Israel (not condeming it's terrible actions) 

-CIA/blackops/paramilitary operations around the world

-backing of dictators and tyrants because they do the bidding of corporate interests

-use of torture

-use of drone strikes





I was raised as a Christian (ECLA Lutheran) and although I am now an agnostic, the moral teachings of Jesus and Christianity have not left me.  Here is my understanding of Christianity and the teachings of Jesus, and I will also say that every civil, intelligent conversation I have had about religion has ended with these same conclusions:

-Everyone should try their very best to follow the golden rule, the second commandment, or whatever you want to call it:  ""Love thy neighbor as thyself,""  ""treat others how you want to be treated,"" etc.  It's a pretty universal moral code amongst humanity, but is specifically important to Christianity

-People are not perfect.  They commit sins.  But if you try to live your life to the best of your ability following the golden rule, to care for and love others as yourself, and confess your sins to be forgiven by Jesus/God, then you will be saved.  You can get into all the ins and outs of the ""resurrection,"" but when it comes down to it, the sacrifice and resurrection of Jesus is to forgive the sins of those who attempt to live good lives and sincerely admit/confess their sins.  If you don't actually mean it and feel remorse, it's meaningless.

-God is love, submit yourself to the will of God, humble yourself before God, you are nothing compared to God, love God with all of your heart, etc.

Here are some relevant Jesus quotes:

""A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.""

""But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.""

""For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and suffer the loss of his soul?""

""If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.""

""I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.""

""For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and everyone who humbles himself will be exalted.""

""Give to everyone who begs from you; and of him who takes away your goods do not ask them again. And as you wish that men would do to you, do so to them.""

""All the commandments: You shall not commit adultery, you shall not kill, you shall not steal, you shall not covet, and so on, are summed up in this single command: You must love your neighbor as yourself.""

""For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?""

Now the main reason why I disaffiliated myself from Christianity can be best described by a quote of Gandhi: “I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.”  That and I realized there is a high probability that Jesus did not actually exist, at least as we fantasize him as having supernatural powers.  But the teachings and moral code of Jesus/Christianity is an entirely separate entity that exists outside of any supernatural belief.  And it is this observation that makes me ask why/how the United States can call itself a Christian nation and do the things it does?  Or you substitute ""Christain nation"" for ""morally superior"" or some other similar term.  I think it's a fairly prominent belief here that ""we are the good guys,"" so whatever we have to do to maintain our power and lifestyle, we are absolutely justified in doing.  But how can you be a true Christian, and actively support that?  That seems to directly contradict the teachings of Jesus in so many ways.  Please prove me wrong.  And please provide specific examples.

I would like to think that the school curriculum was chosen with good intentions.  Except looking back on it now, I really don't believe that.  I would like to believe that, except I don't.

So for English in tenth grade, we had novels assigned designed to promote diversity and an awareness of injustice against other races.  

To teach us about the problems that black people historically faced in America, we read a book called ""Black Like Me"".  The book, ""Black Like Me"" is about a white man who colored his skin to appear black and went down South in the late 1950's.  The book chronicles his (fairly awful) experiences.  

Except thinking about it now, there must have been hundreds of thousands of black men in the South during this time period.  If we wanted to know what it was like, why didn't we just ask one of them?  Did we really need to send a white man down pretending to be black?  Was that the only way to get a legitimate opinion?  It doesn't feel right.

Then we have the holocaust, and our assigned reading was ""The Hiding Place"" by Corrie Ten Boom.  Which is about two Christian sisters sent to a prison camp for attempting to save Jewish people.  Now don't get me wrong, what they did was incredible, but is it really the best way to teach students about the holocaust with a book written about the suffering of Christians?  Something very crucial seems to be missing here.  It's not like there was some shortage of books written by Jewish people.

So I would like to change my view.  I would like to think that everyone had the best of intentions.  In retrospect, it just doesn't feel right and doesn't seem right.  Who the heck would choose these books and why?

There is no proof that same sex couples are worse parents, NONE.
Since ""no fault"" divorce was introduced, the majority of divorces sighted ""dissatisfaction"" as reason for divorce. Fair enough. People grow apart. It happens. So why not gay marriage?

Not everyone likes the opposite sex in a sexual way. Why force them? Why exclude them from Marriage?

Now that you no longer need a man in a lesbian couple or a woman in a gay couple in order to have children, since adoption and IV are just some of the options available to same sex couples, why not same sex marriage?

"I don't mean it's literally possible to record the experiences and calculate the chance of them occurring randomly, but I mean that if God could and would reveal Himself to someone this way, it would be considered reasonable reason to believe in such a being.

Change my view that 1. God could reveal Himself that way, and/or 2. that such evidence could be trusted (assuming a reasonable, intelligent, otherwise perfectly healthy, open-minded individual). 

I'd also be interested to hear argument against whether a God would do this, although I suspect I've heard it all already, and it just comes down to what kind of God He'd be. 

I'd prefer to debate this somewhat objectively, because it is a dearly-held belief. I saved a girl drowning when I was 8, brought my sister back to life when I was 12, and I watched that same sister undergo literally dozens of surgeries to keep her both alive and healthy, despite doctors misdiagnosing and ignoring problems. The coincidences I encounter almost monthly seem too extraordinary for chance. I'll get hung up on a particular phrase, or re-experience a vivid memory, only to have it be key to my work or some great aspect of my life... Individually, they're nothing signifiant, but put all together... I am a scientist and a statistician, and I just can't see how odds like this couldn't count as some degree of evidence. 

Edit: Slight change to view, or a more accurate understanding of view - rather than basing the value of each personally significant coincidence purely on the (un)likelihood of it happening randomly, I would rather it be weighted by the correlation of a) the amount of personal significance the event held at the time, and b) the unlikelihood of the event occurring randomly. I may not be using the correct terminology, but one when a datum is only considered strong evidence if the conditions are met at the proper ratio. Hopefully someone understands?

"So, let me start off by saying that I have used thePirateBay a number of times to download programs, ebooks, software, ect. However, I view it as something that is ""good while it lasts,"" meaning that I will use it until it ends but when it does end will see that it had too. 

It is sort of like when a store wrongly prices a product and I can by it cheaper. I will by the product, but when the store realizes and corrects the prices I come to the conclusion that the prices were wrong and the correct price is 100% fair. To mer there is no debate on whether the lower price was fair; it was not! In order for the store to make a profit and employ workers they need to have the correct prices. Also if they dont correct the price they may have to stop selling the item from the manufacturer and that may cost more jobs. Jobs that normal people like you and I have. It does not matter how much the manufacturer/store makes in a year, it is still their money that they can use for raises, expansion, health care, ect. Could you imagine if we lived in a world where your wealth made it ok for people to steal from? A world  where I could come to your house and steal your car because you have too much money anyways, and dont need that much money.

IMHO the whole freedom of speech argument is a total cop out. To me that is a totally non issues. It reminds me of when slave states in the US turned slavery into a ""states rights"" issues when it is clearly a racism and money issues. Also, if I was to make a website on how to steal senior citizens social security but label it as ""educational only"" I would 100% see the merits of it getting pulled down. Technically it is ""free speech"" but it is speech aimed solely at stealing someone's hard work.

There is also the argument that because thepiartebay does not host any files and only directs, they are in the clear. However, there have been countless times that someone has been convicted of a crime for being an acquaintance, and some states even have bystander laws to punish people for not stopping a crime. If I was to drive my buddy to a bar house where he kills a man, than I will be indicted on aiding a murder. Sure I may have the right to drive where I want to  but that argument will never hold up in court. Even though I only directed to murderer to the scene and will be held partially responsible

"A recent /r/news thread focused on billionaire George Soros and the millions of dollars of taxes that he has avoided, despite advocating for higher taxes for the wealthy. Many commenters took advantage of this story to identify Soros as a liberal equivalent of the Koch Brothers, a view I am not convinced of.

I tried to distinguish Soros from the Koch brothers by pointing out that while both parties take advantage of current laws, the Kochs can be distinguished by their doggedness in perpetuating those very laws. My comment wasn't well received  from a larger problem of rising oligarchy in the United States.

Upon reflection, I realized that I don't know a lot about the Koch Brothers, apart from what I have heard on reddit and NPR, primarily, over the past few years. Here are some things I think I know:

 The Kochs promote climate change denial, which is useful when one is in the petroleum business
 They astroturfed the Tea Party, which is nominally about freedom from the government and personal liberty (oversimplification?), but conveniently supports a very corporation/billionaire/petroleum industry friendly agenda
 They have a poor environmental track record and support policies that will allow them to continue to harm the environment
 They seek to maintain the low tax rate they enjoy personally, despite massive wealth inequality
 They support low corporate tax rates, through the Tea Party and lobbying

I'm concerned that my opinion is based on years of accumulated sentiments and not much dedicated critical thought. If I'm wrong about the Koch brothers, and as open-minded as I like to think I am, it shouldn't be too tough for you to change my view. Do the Kochs deserve the attention they get as the worst of the wealthy, or are they scapegoats for a self-serving billionaire class?

"I will try to keep this short and to the point. Nearly every day I hear in a conversation, see on an advertisement, or read on the internet something along the lines of: Having sex with a drunk woman regardless of consent is rape. Although I do agree that it is very low for a man to have sex with a drunk woman just because she is drunk and somehow ""easy"" I do NOT agree that if a woman is drunk, has sex, and regrets it later on, that the sex should be considered rape.

The only instance where sex or any sexual acts should be considered as rape is in a situation where the man/woman explicitly says a form of ""no"". whether that is verbal, body language, or otherwise. EDIT: I should note that if a man/woman is passed out, too drunk to speak, or something in a similar pool, I would strongly consider all of those circumstances in which the person cannot express a yes or no to be rape.

I happen to have a close male friend who while he and a woman were drunk, had sex with said woman. This woman grew to dislike my friend and explained to the police that it was rape since she did not know what was happening. Luckily after things got more legal she  backed down and dropped any potential charges. This is only one of so many hundreds of stories similar to this.

In conclusion:
 consent is just the same drunk as it is sober.
 regretted sex (of any kind) is not rape
 It is not a man's job to not have sex with drunk women, rather it is everyone's job to understand consent and to understand that drinking can lead to regrettable/bad decisions.



I want to say again that I am not in favour of sober people having sex with drunk people. I do understand the opposite view thoroughly but I do not agree with it.

I would like to mention that I am a registered independent and will most likely vote for a third party candidate, but I am fairly left wing and agree with the Democratic Party far more often than with the Republican Party. Paul is a pretty progressive guy with a clean record (as far as I know) and his views on many issues differ greatly from the rest of the GOP. While Clinton is very experienced and progressive, she seems like the perfect archetype of the classic sketchy and dishonest politician who is willing to use her power to do whatever it takes to do what she wants.

"Going back 100's of years, since humans formed societies, men and women offered their natural resources in exchanges for sustenance, but in different ways.

"Islam is a religion that spawned from the Quran, a religious text considered to be the Word of God (Allah). This religion began in the Arabian peninsula in the early 600s. 

Islam is not only out of date, dangerous to today's society and subversive, but it has always been a violent religion. This would be fine if Islam could be reformed. But that's the trouble with Islam. It has not been widely reformed and I'm afraid it cannot be due to its structure. Sure, it has a similar structure

The concept of Dar-al-harb/Garb/Kufr (War, War(ottoman),Infidel) and the Dar-al-Islam (Islam/Peace) is one that divides the world into two; nations that follow the law of Islam (Shariah) and those that don't. Before you say that this practice is outdated and out of style, please look at Salafis, the extremist groups in the middle east, and this fine fellow and other people like him that do not classify as salafis(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV710c1dgpU). Even if the Quran is not taken literally, Shariah law still applies. I have lived in an Islamic country. You do not need to take the Hadith and Quran literally to be subject to literal Shariah law.

Read here:
Looking at the Malaysian legal system as a whole, sharia law plays a relatively small role in defining the laws on the country. It only applies to Muslims. With regards to civil law, the Syariah courts has jurisdiction in personal law matters, for example marriage, inheritance, and apostasy. In some states there are sharia criminal laws, for example there is the Kelantan Syariah Criminal Code Enactment 1993. Their jurisdiction is however limited to imposing fines for an amount not more than RM 5000, and imprisonment to not more than 3 years. In August 2007, the then Chief Justice of Malaysia proposed to replace the current common law application in Malaysia with sharia law

You can literally go to jail for renouncing Islam. It's far more serious in countries like Saudi Arabia, and 4 in 10 muslims in the UK want to establish Shariah law. In fact, there are 85 shariah law courthouses in the UK which run by court-approval basis. I personally believe that the political stress plus the fact that both parties signed an agreement to be judged by shariah law makes every case a stamp-and-go case. Before you say that both if both parties consent to it, it's alright, please think about the cultural and familial pressure of Islam and their treatment of women.

We must not forget Islam's borderline slavery of women. They are covered, silenced, veiled, separated, and treated as commodity. God willing, they at least inherit half the amount a man of the same level of descendence would.

I do not say that muslims are bad people and must convert to be part of today's society. I do not say that at all. In fact, I say the opposite. If anything can stop the self-indulgent hedonism of today's society it is Muslims (And Sikhs). I just say that Islam conflicts with today's society, and it cannot be wholly compatible with today's world. I do not approve of Islam.

"Unfortunately, the only time Amtrak specifically and passenger rail generally become a part of public discussion seems to be when something goes wrong. Most of you are probably aware that something did go wrong last week, when Amtrak's Northeast Regional #188 derailed in Pennsylvania. This CMV is not about that incident, however.

I have long held the view that the passenger rail should, and inevitably will, become a much larger part of our national transportation mix. I've yet to hear a thoughtful, legitimate argument against greater investment in passenger rail, specifically Amtrak. Most people who oppose Amtrak, particularly in Congress, seem to be doing so based on ideological or political reasons. For example, the last Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has called Amtrak a ""Soviet style railroad"". Most criticisms of Amtrak I've heard are similarly based in ideological beliefs. 

Now, I will try to briefly summarize some of the key reasons I've long thought Amtrak should be a top priority for investment and expanded funding.

 Critics of Amtrak often point to the fact that it is a money losing operation, and is consequently subsidized by taxpayer money. This is perhaps the most common complaint from some (not all) Republicans. The way I see it, all modes of transportation are heavily subsidized, and Amtrak should not be singled out for losing money. All railroads, public and private, are responsible for all of their infrastructure. That means every inch of rail, every freight terminal and passenger station, every locomotive and car, their traffic management systems, and even their own police departments. By contrast, we (the taxpayer) fund the construction and maintenance of airports and highways. We pay for the FAA, which manages private airline traffic. We pay for the TSA, which provides security for the airlines. We pay for traffic officers in police departments. The bankrupt Highway Trust Fund, paid for by the federal gas tax, no longer covers all of its costs. Consequently, Congress has bailed it out with short term extensions for more than eight years now. According to Amtrak's CEO, Joe Boardman, these ""bailouts"" have added up to more than Amtrak's entire operating subsidy since its inception in 1975. So, with all this in mind, it seems ridiculous to single out passenger rail as the only transportation mode that needs to be profitable and should not be subsidized. We subsidize all modes, and all lose money, why should Amtrak be the one exception?

 Even if Amtrak was as burdensome on taxpayers as some politicians and pundits suggest, there seems to be a strong public interest in expanding passenger rail. Unlike road and air competition, even if you personally do not use Amtrak, you benefit from higher Amtrak ridership. According to the Brookings Institute, Amtrak is now the fastest growing method of transportation. Its broken its ridership records nearly every year for the past 12 years, with the Northeast Corridor (NEC) in particular booming since the introduction of the Acela. Amtrak controls more than 75% of all air-rail traffic in the Northeast, which benefits air and road travelers as well. Less traffic on our already congested highways, less traffic in our airports, less pollution in our air, and downward pressure on the demand for oil are all secondary effects that benefit people who do not use Amtrak.

 If lowering our dependence on foreign oil via decreased demand and if global warming is a concern for you as it is for me, then prioritizing rail over air and road transportation seems to be a necessity. Trains are masters of efficiency in a way that even the most fuel efficient jet and greenest hybrid are not. According to the Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics, in 2012 Amtrak's energy intensity per passenger mile sat at 1,561 British thermal units. By contrast, the average domestic airline service uses 2,477 BTUs per passenger mile. For some reason, 2006 is the last available data on passenger cars, and they used 2,898 BTUs and light trucks used 5,465 BTUs per passenger mile. Even private freight carriers are extremely efficient. According to FreightRailWorks.com, the average train can move one ton of freight 475 miles on one gallon of fuel. These facts suggest to me that the future lies in rail, not road, and that further Amtrak expansion could help lower our national energy consumption and transportation related pollution.

So Change My View! Like I said, most arguments against Amtrak seem overly politicized. So I'm interested to hear any cogent argument opposing passenger rail investment generally or Amtrak specifically. I suppose the latter is likely easier to make than the former, because it could be possible to support passenger rail investment but oppose Amtrak as an entity. If this is your argument, I would be interested in hearing what alternatives to a federally subsidized passenger rail corporation are out there.

"As can be seen in this image, it is legal to turn right on red from the inmost lane, but if there is more than one right-only turn lane, all others are prohibited from turning right on red.


I do not see why this is.  If it is legal to turn right on red after checking for incoming traffic from your left in one lane, why would it not be in another?  I don't think there is a significant likelihood of cars from more than one turn lane crashing into each other.

I also don't think it likely that a vehicle turning right on red from the leftmost right turn lane would be more likely to collide with oncoming traffic.  Surely he would check both lanes of traffic before turning, just as the inside lane would check the rightmost incoming traffic lane as well as whether there is anyone that might be changing lanes into his lane before the intersection.

However, I imagine that someone somewhere had a reason for making this a law, so I am quite willing to change my view if given reasoning as to why turning right on red from anything but the inside lane is predominantly illegal.

Edit: going to bed. I posted this on a whim and didn't think about the time required for a detailed discussion. Thanks for the comments. I'll respond more tomorrow.

"Though my personal political views match those of Bernie Sanders much more than Hillary Clinton, I believe nominating Bernie could ultimately be very damaging for the progressive cause. My main concern with nominating Sanders is that he will alienate all voters except for the left and the end result will be a 48-state Reagan v. Mondale style steamrolling. A GOP presidency, possible supermajority in both houses and 1-3 supreme court nominations could be enough to nullify the limited progress we've had under Obama. 

A Clinton presidency would probably look very similar to Obama's, and come with a lot of disappointments. I do think it's possible that we might see progress towards things like a single-payer healthcare system that progressives have wanted all along.

I'm a 32 year old woman and mother of 3. I've had sex with my father and some other family members.

I don't feel dirtied or damaged or like my life outcomes have been limited, degraded, whatever.

When I've told people - which I very, very rarely do - I'm almost always informed that I'm, in effect, damaged goods, a victim who ought to have grievances and do something drastic and legal against my father because he ruined me. I resent this. I'm fine and I'm glad he helped me feather my wings. 

So why are incest and pederasty wrong? I can see how both - especially that last - are almost always wrong in our culture and in the typical environments and instances. Sure. No doubt. Rape is abhorrent. Molestation is abhorrent. Adults using children as sex toys is truly terrible.

But loving sex with one's family and early introductions? I just don't understand why I'm supposed to consider it to be so wrong and feel so ashamed.

"I have several opinions on this matter.  

First, even if it becomes more common for people to post pictures of women topless, private sites like Facebook or Instagram are fully entitled to block/remove those posts.  They are private websites, so they can choose what is decent and indecent to be posted.  

Secondly, although I am conservative in nature, I think it is best for Western Culture to adopt a ""no nipples"" censorship.  

I think that nipples are sexualized features in all genders, and if there is a huge concern with there being inequality in male vs. female nipple showing, then it should be taboo for anyone to show their nipples, and topless pictures (of all genders) should be removed.

I would love to have my mind opened to why people want the female nipple freed, instead of having the male nipple banned.  I sincerely do not understand their view.  So, CMV!

-will provide for them and take care of them in the long run

-is as hot as Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt or Christian Bale

-that is rich and wealthy

-that's gonna give them the will and ability to make all their other girlfriends jealous

-and the list goes on

"Whilst browsing Reddit, I come across comments with surprising popularity that endorse the idea that people who have committed a crime are fully deserving of a physical punishment, often carried out by someone acting on the interests of the victim, regardless of what the law has to say on the matter. Posts talking about fathers beating up boys who cheat on their daughter, or killing a man who drove drunk and killed their son in the process, often receive support following the idea that ‘they totally deserved it, they were awful people’.

I feel that this is a barbaric way of looking at things. Many people seem to be of the opinion that ‘an eye for an eye’ is the best form of justice, that it settles all disputes. This person killed someone, so we should kill them. That person cheated, they should get beaten up. Fair is fair right? 

But that’s just revenge, defined as ‘the action of hurting or harming someone in return for an injury or wrong suffered at their hands’. Does a person who cheated, whilst it is an undeniably awful breach of trust, deserve to receive physical punishment for their actions? The aggrieved might think so, but I find it incredible that even people who are not directly involved are not reasonable enough to admit that this shouldn’t happen.

In more serious cases, such as murder, I still do not believe that the perpetrator’s death can bring about anything other than brief respite for the aggrieved. I understand that people feel that killing a murderer improves society by their absence, but I believe that whilst idealistic, the method of attempted rehabilitation is preferable (and actually is cheaper, if that should be a factor at all) than killing the person. I don’t think a person forfeits their human rights by breaching those of another, as doing so would make those in charge of their fate act as the accused has acted. 

The punishment for a crime should not be decided by the victim or those with the victim’s interests at heart, and such actions should not be celebrated. Instead, a group of unbiased individuals who can make their decision based on justice should decide, not revenge.

TL;DR Explain to me why the punishment someone receives for their actions should be based on revenge for the victim and not an unbiased judgement based on justice.

"Dear reader, let me re-introduce you to an argument known as ""Pascal's Wager"", which you probably know about if you decided to look here. 

From Wikipedia:
  It posits that humans all bet with their lives either that God exists or not. Given the possibility that God actually does exist and assuming an infinite gain or loss associated with belief or unbelief in said God (as represented by an eternity in heaven or hell), a rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God. If God does not actually exist, such a person will have only a finite loss (some pleasures, luxury, etc.). Pascal formulated the wager within a Christian framework. 

I am addressing the counter-arguments of ""Nature as not a proof of the existence of God"" and ""Argument from inauthentic belief"", which you should read about if you would like to talk to me about those.

Since I'm not great at reported speech, I will quote the thoughts of my imaginary atheist:

I am an atheist. I believe there is no deity or higher power which governs nature.

As such, I am most probably damned by a great number of religions.

If I love my child, and if wish it well, I must do everything in my power to secure that.

One of those things is instilling faith into my child. 

I should feign faith, as hard as I can, to make my child a believer, and a practicing one, at best.

That way, their faith will be sincere and strong, even if mine is not, saving them, and MAYBE EVEN me in the process.

I only see as conflicting the ""Argument from inconsistent revelations"",
Since there have been many religions throughout history, and therefore many conceptions of God (or gods), some assert that all of them need to be factored into the wager, in an argument known as the argument from inconsistent revelations. This, its proponents argue, would lead to a high probability of believing in ""the wrong god"", which, they claim, eliminates the mathematical advantage Pascal claimed with his Wager.

e but even so, instilling ANY faith could still be better than NO faith, more because a number of deities value believers more than non-believers.

As such, Change My View, from the standpoint that there is multiple religions, and, for the sake of argument, from the standpoint that there is only one religion in the world (imagine a planet of only Christians and atheists, or Jews and atheists, etc.)

tl;dr - I should teach my kid to believe in God and be a good human being, and not just the latter.

"Okay, so this is something I see very often and sparks arguments fast. I've heard a lot about this ""sex and gender are not the same"", but that is not agreed on by all. Actually, if I have understood correctly (from Wikipedia, but ofc it might be wrong) the view is mostly held by those who study womens' studies/gender studies, and not even all of those. Sex and gender are used interchangeably in common speech in English, and do not have separate words in my native tongue.

I do not mean to say that there are no such thing as trans people. But trans people are not their own gender. A woman who identifies as a man is a man and not a FtM-gibberishgender. At least I haven't met any transgender people who want to identify as something else than male, female or intersex. If someone is physically female and identifies as toothpaste, I do not know if that is a gender. 

The three genders then would be male, meaning either strictly those with a penis, or anyone who identifies as a male, female, meaning either everyone with a vagina or anyone who identifies as a female, and intersex, either strictly meaning anyone who is not cis male or cis female, or anyone who does not associate themselves with the two other genders.

I am myself in favour of the less strict versions.

"So, I'm a senior in highschool right now. I fell really deep into senioritis (the condition where one has gotten into college but remains in highschool until graduation, and becomes exceedingly lazy) and managed to convince my parents that my bad grades (aka so bad I was close to NOT graduating) were a result of undiagnosed attention deficit. I've since been prescribed vyvanse. Now, the difference on this stuff is incredible. I am motivated, I am hardworking, and I am happy when I'm on it. I am a fully productive member of society when I'm on this stimulant. Furthermore, I've visited the adderall/vyavnse subreddits/forums and the consensus is mostly the same. Its a goddamned ""magic pill"". 



Mainly, the users I read that dislike it are the ones who were put on the stuff at an exceedingly early age. Which I agree is a (for the most part) terrible thing. Especially if they never really had an attention deficit disorder.

The thing is, I don't see why we prevent people who don't have add from taking this (other than the potential for abuse). A lazy, unproductive person wants to turn himself around and become productive? I don't see why they shouldn't have the opportunity to take this. Someone needs to do some spring cleaning but can't get themselves to do it? Why prevent them from using this? 

Overall, I just see these stimulants as a tool. And furthermore, from a societal perspective, its use by people seems to be almost entirely beneficial.

Now, there is the potential for abuse. I want to disregard this part for discussion, however. 2 reasons: 1) I only want to talk about the people without ADHD but who want to self-improve. 2) those who want to abuse can already do so in that its not extremely difficult to get it illegally.

One other point is that it provides an unfair advantage to students. Well, I see it as a choice. If you use it it is entirely up to the individual. The people who feel disadvantaged have an equal opportunity to get it (disregarding prices). There are already people without ADHD using the drugs, the only difference is that they pretend to have it. 

A final point that I think some people have is the ""zombification"" of students. I say that's bullshit though. Personally, I've never been happier with both my academics ""and my social life. Never before have I had so much time to enjoy my free time because I'm no longer aimlessly procrastinating or taking forever to do simple assignments.

With that said I find it kind of scary that there is a Clinton and a Bush in this election.

People seem to rather want to vote on people from families they know than random people.

To me it kind of seems like America is getting set in their political dynasties and that if this development continues, we might end up with a system where everyone in theory can try to be elected president, but in practise it will always be people from the same political dynasties that gets elected.

"The fact that men are disadvantaged in child custody cases is appalling. So is that fact that men who call the police to report domestic violence against them are more likely to be arrested than the ACTUAL PERPETRATOR. That's disgusting, and obviously I could list many other real problems.

But the MRM is not the best solution to these problems, and often gives men's issues such bad press that it's toxic to defend them. In other words, it's not the MRM's fault that these problems exist, but it's actively damaging to the cause, quite possibly more than it has helped.

Distancing itself from feminism breaks the gender equality world into ""men's activists"" and ""women's activists."" This causes us to ignore that gender inequality is bad for everyone. No one wins when a man is arrested for being assaulted by a woman. This is not a victory for women's rights. Everyone loses, because a criminal walks free while an innocent person sits in jail. Sure, there are extremists who will claim to hate all men and think this is fine, but there are also crazy atheists who claim to hate all religious people. This isn't ""no true Scotsman,"" this is pointing out that it's unreasonable to define a group by its crazies, because if we did, no group would be reasonable. 

Pitting MRAs against feminists undermines the notion of actual gender equality and makes it a ""men vs. women"" debate, which we all lose. 

It would seem, to me, that a better strategy to promote men's issues would be to do it within the feminist movement. The feminist movement has existed for a long time and (relative to the MRM) is reasonably positively regarded. People get behind feminist issues. MRAs often complain that no feminists care about men's issues, but a) this doesn't seem to be entirely true unless we're yelling about strawmen and extremists and b) this would be even less true if people stopped leaving feminism/gender egalitarianism for the MRM. It looks like people are ditching feminism for the MRM and then complaining that feminists don't care about men's issues, which is only true because anyone who did left. Why can't we all just work together? I get that there are people who identify with all of the above, but it seems like EVERYONE who considers themselves ANY of the above should care about all of the above. I really can't think of an intellectually honest reason to care only about men's issues or women's issues. They're both real. So why are we treating them as opposing forces? It's not like we have to ban abortions because we start listening to male victims of violence. This isn't a zero sum game, why is it being treated as one? Everyone seems to think it is, and it just doesn't make sense to me.

Some things I anticipate people saying:

""What about gender egalitarians?""

I think rebranding feminism as gender egalitarianism would probably be the best solution, but that's going to take a hell of a lot of time. One thing that would help is if feminists started acting like gender egalitarians and actually cared about all gender issues, and MRAs joining up with them would only speed up the process. As for people who consider themselves ""feminists and gender egalitarians,"" I see no issue. ""Feminist, MRA, and gender egalitarian"" is fine too, although I've never encountered one who phrased it like that. Those who consider themselves anti-feminists but gender egalitarians... Eh. I really don't know, but I feel like shitting on feminism in general is not helpful to the gender equality discussion. (this is as opposed to legitimate critiquing, which is fair game. I'm not saying anything anyone labelled ""feminist"" does is above reproach, nor anything the movement does. I'm saying condemning all of modern feminism and trying to start from scratch is really unhelpful, especially when a huge part of the world is still incredibly patriarchal; see countries where getting raped is still a crime--if you're female). 

""Feminists aren't open to men's issues. I hear what you're saying, but that's not possible.""

Become a feminist open to men's issues. You're listening to one right now. Make that two and we're one step closer.

""It's right for men's and women's issues to have different advocates because they are different. You might as well be saying that feminism should just merge with the LGBTQ rights movement.""

I don't think that's true. Men's and women's issues differ, but they are rooted in the same fundamental ideas. The reason men are arrested when they are the victim of domestic violence by women is that we live in a society that sees women differently from men. It's benevolently sexist to say that a woman simply couldn't hurt a man except in self-defense. It's also hostile sexist against men to say that men are simply violent people. Men's and women's issues are intrinsically linked, because stereotypes and perceptions of gender roles are the root of both. Essentially, I think men's and women's issues are symptoms of the same problem, so they can be addressed together.

""Is your problem with anti-feminists, or MRAs? You seem to move between the two.""

Both, to some degree. I don't think it's fair to treat those two entirely separately, given the links. MRAs who are anti-feminist are the ones I disagree with most. People who identify as MRAs but also feminists I'm largely okay with, but the MRM in general is not terribly kind to feminists and borders on actively anti-feminist, which is the problem I'm talking about here.

Edit: Guys, I want to have a conversation! I really am open to chatting about this and changing my view. I know lots of CMV users love the MRM, it gets brought up all the time... I want to understand your perspective. I don't bite.

Edit2: Well, I asked and you delivered! Definitely an interesting conversation here. Credit to u/Prince_of_Savoy for highlighting issues with feminism that make it inherently poorly compatible with the MRM. I'll be checking back and responding to comments that might get added later tonight, but I may not get to all of them--sorry about that! I am reading and listening to all that is said, and I appreciate the many varied takes on the issue that have come up.

Edit3: Okay, there are still new, good comments being posted, but there's also a fair bit of needless vitriol.

"I'm an anti-feminist. I support equal rights activism, but I don't support feminism, and here is my main reason (one of them).

I feel that many modern American feminists don't understand the process of argument, and they tend to ignore the opposing opinion.

Here is an example: I see so many feminists take a magazine cover like this and say that the former is sexually objectifying women, while the second is praising men for being successful. 

I would post the link to the pro-feminist list that said this, but the link isn't working (TheAmazingAtheist made a video on the list, but the link he gave didn't work for me)

The reason I feel this argument holds little merit is for a few reasons:

1) GQ is a men's magazine (the magazine in the images), so of course it will use sexually attractive women and succesful looking men to attract men to the magazine, that's called advertising. 

2) A magazine called ""Men's health magazine"" has covers that show sexually attractive men. Is that wrong? No, the point of the magazine is to attract men who want to be healthy, and having a man who is sexy on the cover will attract those men to be like ""I wanna be sexy too!""

3) This argument infers the opinion that human sexuality is ""bad"" and can not be shown off.

The above three statements can be reworded and applied to many feminist ideas. 

I am not saying that all Feminist arguments are illogical, but many of them are, because many American feminists aren't looking at the right issues.

TL;DR: Many American-feminist's ideas have very little backing.

"I believe that capital punishment is a requirement for any society to function and the arguments for its opposition are null. 

If I had the power to change laws regarding capital punishment, I would expand the system and loosen the noose on what is regarded as cruel and unusual (ie hanging). When preformed correctly, hanging is effective and swift and a prisoner's pain (if any) is negligible. 

I would also change how quickly a sentence is carried out. No longer does a prisoner sit on death row for the majority of his life. Strap him down and hit him with the benzos as soon as legally possible. This would reduce strain on government funds, overcrowded prisons, and the tax payer's dollar. 

Miscarriages of justice in regards to capital punishment are often overblown and with with the advent of DNA evidence and other technologies are more than likely in decline. 

People who argue that it is a greater to punishment rot in a cell underestimate a prisoner's comfort. Three meals a day, a bed to sleep on and clothes on your back is more than many people have outside the first world and many prisoners have athletic facilities and TV. Following the logic of what is a greater punishment is foolish because it's not about the greatness of the punishment, it's about justice being served. If you think rotting in a cell is more punishment than death, the same logic would follow: torture is a greater punishment than rotting in a cell which I am opposed to. 

Death and pain aren't mutually exclusive, but sometimes they coincide; and if that means the perpetrator of a heinous crime feels something human so be it. Not all of life is comfortable and the general public are grossly sensitized to death because it is feared, misunderstood, and unknown. 

I look forward to discussion! Thanks for reading.

"Shot composition is, in my opinion, one of the most important aspects of good cinematography, and yet despite the incredibly high production values, wonderful costumes, lavish sets, and generally decent acting, Game of Thrones never seems to make the most of the things it chooses to point a camera at. 


There's something very unambitious and utilitarian about the way the shots are composed. In every episode, we're treated with one or two shots which feel like a bit of thought has gone into where the camera will be positioned and how the shot will be framed. In the most recent episode, for example, there were a few nice shots where two characters are on a beach, reflected by the wet sand. And the action scenes are generally pretty good. But the dialogue scenes are just bland. Most of the dialogue scenes between two characters follow a very uninteresting formula:


 One character is doing something quietly by themselves (reading, eating, thinking, sweeping, etc.)
 The other character approaches. We'll get a lot of static shots with both characters in the frame
 The conversation plays out, and generally neither actor will really do much during the conversation. If they were doing something before (like making a fire) they'll keep doing it, but otherwise they'll either just sit there or stand there. Only in the most extreme of cases (usually during life-or-death bits) will they let emotion actually allow them to use gestures, or do things while speaking. They're reminiscent of Skyrim characters in that way. This wouldn't be such a problem if the camera wasn't so static and uninteresting also. We'll get lots of 'shot reverse-shot', lots of static shots with both characters in, and generally every shot will be there merely to be pointed at whoever is speaking and little more. There seems no attempt to use the beautiful language of cinema to convey emotion. That scene between Jon Snow and Brian Blessed in the most recent episode, for example, was not half as tense as it could have been in the hands of more competent cinematographers.


I mean, put it this way. Watch this bit (1:20:39)https://youtu.be/ABcXyZn9xjg?t=4839 of RedLetterMedia's excellent review of Star Wars: Episode 3. I feel you could almost lift RLM's criticism and apply it directly to Game of Thrones. Other than, as I've mentioned, the occasional decent shot (normally one per episode) and very occasionally a shot which is actually memorable (normally one per season) - can you really say Game of Thrones understands the power of shot composition any more than Episode 3 does?


One more point based on what I anticipate I will get in reply to this: I don't think it's unfair to hold TV shows to the same high standard of cinematography that films achieve. We've seen what TV shows can achieve with great filming: Breaking Bad (particularly the episodes directed by Rian Johnson such as 'Fly', 'Ozymandias' and '51') frames shots to help us understand its characters through the power of symbolism. Garth Marenghi's Darkplace exploits the limitations of the film medium for comedic effect. Even hit-and-miss shows like Sherlock manage to shoot scenes in creative, interesting ways. Game of Thrones, however, seems almost entirely utilitarian in its approach. As long as we can see what's going on in each shot, that's good enough for them.

"This argument does not have to do with innocent people being improperly sentenced to death, this is set in a hypothetical case where guilt was proven beyond a shadow of a doubt. 

I believe that if you have been sentenced to death that means your crime was so heinous that you are deemed irreparable, a permanent threat to society. Why should we show any concern with someone we are about to kill? The murderer (for example) did not show concern with the well being of their victim, so why should we do the same? Would it not benefit society if we could save money and use bullets or a rope every time?

"Some Context: Frist off I grew up around the Boston area, graduated from a college in Boston, currently work and live in Boston, was on the marathon route (about 2 miles away) when the bombing occurred, I always have and always will consider Boston home.

Secondly, I am not asking people to explain why they feel he they believe he should receive the death penalty or not. Or even why his crimes are worthy of the death penalty. His actions are reprehensible, and I fully believe he is guilty and should receive punishment in accordance with law befitting his crimes.

Anyways,

The bombing and subsequent manhunt resulted in 4 deaths and a dozens of injuries. Clearly a terrible tragedy, please do not misconstrue me, I think that what happened was awful.

However, I think the response, especially around Boston has been extremely disproportionate.
News articles, to blogs, to overheard conversations, to David Ortiz, for the past 2 years all you hear is a sensationalized response that includes hate speech, violent calls for vengeance, overly emotional opining, and nonsense about ""Boston strong"" that arises from mob mentality I have seen countless comments on articles saying incredibly vengeful and disturbing things wished on Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, ""I want to see him hang in the streets"" is a very mild example. Additionally I have seen a lot of anti-Muslim rhetoric and straight out bigotry because of these events.
BostonStrong has become synonymous with the city and its prominent organizations. A charity for the victims (some of which include very profitable retail business in Copley Square) of the bombing has gathered millions in donations. I have seen people even tangentially related to Boston claiming it was an emotional and devastating event for them, again not victims, but someone who might have lived in Boston a few years back. What does Boston Strong even mean? I personally believe it means nothing. Boston reacted the way any city would to two rogue terrorists. It started as a way to raise money for the one fund but has devolved into nothing more than a marketing gimmick for area businesses and something for bros to use as a hashtag.

However when you look at the outrage, vitriol, and media coverage surrounding other violent crimes, for example serial rape, multiple homicides, pedophilia, even drunk driving homicides. The level of interest and reaction is not even close.

I understand it was a very public event with terrorist intentions, but people in Boston act like it's the next 9/11. It simply is not. No where near the damage and no connection to an international terrorist organization.

In many ways I think the actions of drunk drivers who kill a car full of innocents are as much or more reprehensible than those of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. A drunk driver kills someone due to their own selfishness and stupidity. Dzhokhar and his brother believed they were getting justice for innocent people killed in Afghanistan and Iraq. He knew very well that he would likely be caught, and yet he believed strongly enough that what he was doing was right that he went through with it then penned a letter in blood stating his motive as he lay dying in a boat.

I'm not defending his actions I think they are terrible but I think the outrage and rah-rah mob mentality and blind patriotism (city-ism?) I've seen for the past two years is grossly misplaced. The Boston Strong mentality is flawed, the Tsarnaevs didn't attack Boston they attacked the US, Boston just happened to be where they lived, and while it was great to see a city come together after a tragedy I believe the Boston Strong thing was taken too far. Around college campuses it became a rallying cry to legitimize bigotry about immigrants from the middle east and an excuse to party, meanwhile atrocities committed by born and bred Americans go largely unnoticed.

While no one I know personally was injured by the events, I am still from Boston but I failed to be personally hurt or particularly jarred by these events. Meanwhile, I witnessed students who had been in the city for a handful of months post impassioned social media posts calling for executions and making claims to how strong and resilient ""their city was"", no one was gonna mess with ""their"" town that they had been inhabiting for a whopping 1.5 college semesters.

I think his crimes were terrible, but no more terrible than other similar crimes, and certainly not warranting the reaction that has occurred since Marathon Monday 2013. I just can't get behind the lynch mob, or the notion that somehow Boston reacted better than any other city would.

TLDR- The hate, vitriol, and mob mentality surrounding the Dzhokhar Tsarnaev case is blown way out of proportion, considering atrocities that occur every day. this is particularly bad in Boston and even worse in Boston student communities.

"This is naturally an incredibly controversial topic and I highly doubt that many people will agree with me, but I feel compelled to discuss this. 

This needs to be prefaced by saying that all of this is based on averages, not individuals. I'm sure many women are more capable than many men, what I'm saying is that the general trend across the board is that on average a male worker is more productive. 

Men work almost triple the amount of overtime hours than women.

Men work more standard hours than women.

Women take more sick days off work than men.

Women are more likely than men to take several years of maternity leave off of work.

A small percentage of women undergo severe PMS and consequently work at a diminished capacity for several days of each month.

To use anecdotal evidence, yesterday i came in to work, to find that all 8 garbages were completely filled. This was strange, since the closing crew is supposed to take out the garbages every night. I asked my coworker why no one had done the garbages last night, and I was effectively told that only girls were working the closing shift, and none of them wanted to touch the garbages because they thought it was gross. So I had to take out 8 garbages first thing in the morning, because I was a man. Additionally, the parking lot was overflowing with trash that had spilled out of the over-packed garbage cans, but none of the girls had done the usual nightly responsibility of sweeping, since they thought it was a man's job as well. I'm not talking about one or two co-workers here, there were 7 women on shift, and every single one of them followed this gender stereotyped idea of what closing responsibilities they should have. Its one thing if men and women divide tasks based on relative strengths and weaknesses, but if someone neglects to do a task because there's no one of the opposite sex to assign it to, that is ridiculous. When only men are closing, someone still ends up washing the dishes and shining the countertops. 


Due to the biological, sociological, and psychological factors that women face, they are on average less suited to performing excessive labour, and in an economic system where more work = more money, it is no surprise that men make more than women. 

What I find most surprising is that when I bring up this issue, I am met with incredible opposition, as if I am trying to oppress women or promote sexism. The truth is, an entire branch of feminism exists for the very reasons I have stated; socialist feminism believes that men have a higher capacity to work and are therefore at an advantage in a capitalist society. They believe the only way wage equality can happen is through instating socialist policies that ensure employers are forced to pay men and women equally. 

I am not saying that women deserve to be paid less because they have children for example, humanity needs new people to be born , and as such women should not be penalized for taking time off work to raise children. However, we do not live in a moral democracy. We live in a capitalist democracy, where employers are free to pay their employees whatever they think is proportional to the revenue or work that each specific employee will bring to the company. On average, certainly not always, but on average, men can generate slightly more work and revenue than women. 

Thus, the only way women can achieve equal pay is through socialist change in legislation. ","{'men', 'male'}"
"I don't sympathize with the idea of avoiding the paying of taxes (unless they really go off-the-grid) nor with the idea of doing without family courts and all other institutions they think ""favour women"".

But I think the idea of some men just forgoing the pursuit of romantic, sexual or social relationships with women isn't bad. Nor I think the idea of just focusing the energy and time one would employ in social activities into improving oneself in another way is bad neither.

I think there's a group of men who simply aren't going to do well with women in general, so it's a waste of their time to try to ""improve"" in that area. It's also harmful that unwanted men just go out there and try to sympathize with people who look down on them, looking for pity. I also think that no one will disagree with the fact that it's not as though as a few less men in the social spheres is going to change anything. In fact, it may even benefit women and other men, since they don't have to deal with people they don't like or who they look down on.

It's beneficial for those men who are considered losers, who are looked down on, to focus on improving their lives elsehow. It allows them to improve their self-esteem, their happiness, without having to deal with people who despise them or having to crawl down to their knees asking for pity. All that with the additional benefit that it doesn't bother the people who despise them at all: it even manages to eliminate them from their social circles. So, it's a win-win situation for all people involved.

I think it's a more than valid and beneficial option for men who are bound to be looked down on by the majority of women in terms of romantic and sexual relationships for things out of their control (ugly men, short men, small penis men).

"Edit: She's studying ""musical theatre"", acting is a limited part of it. There's plenty of parts that don't require kissing and it's fairly easy to avoid.

I feel that it's a special thing that should only occur between partners. I know and fully understand it's ""just a job"" but it still physically happens, that's the problem. I believe that kissing another human being really sends some emotional signals in the brain that can trigger attraction / connection and I know of several cases where a relationship on screen has led to a relationship off screen. I'm in a band and if we did a video where there was a situation where the director asked me to kiss another girl, I'd refuse. If I was an actor I'd refuse to kiss another girl. I know I should trust my girlfriend, but she has lied to me (only little ones I guess) on a few occasions recently. But I don't know who can be trusted, especially when I know that scientifically, kissing another human being makes changes in the brain and builds these connections. I still count it as cheating. But I don't want to stop her from doing anything. If we get married and spend the rest of our lives together then I'd want her to be my ""last first kiss"" and I'd epxect the same the other way round.

I told her that there's loads of jobs available that don't require kissing (she seems to think she's never going to be offered those kinds of scenes anyway due to her being short). There's quite a few actors / actresses that refuse to do kissing scenes because they have a partner (e.g. Kirk Cameron). But I also said that I don't want to stop her from doing anything - if she wants / feels like she needs to do those scenes, then she should but we'd have to end the relationship. If she needs to do that then I'd prefer her to be happy, but I wouldn't want it to sacrifice my personal beliefs.

"As an adult man who counts calories daily, I'm always trying to find food that is cheap and either easy to prepare or possible to prepare all at once at the start of the week. I've tried several alternatives including salads and slow cooked meat, but they tended to be expensive and not necessarily keep or reheat as well as I'd like.

For that reason, I present lunchables, specifically the cheese pizza kind, as the best choice for me for dinner. They are cheap, costing between $1 and $2 each depending on sales and how far I'm willing to drive to buy them. They keep in the refrigerator all week with no issue. They have only 270 calories, allowing me to supplement the meal in a number of ways without going over my daily limit. They have 16g protein, which is not as good as meat dishes but is still quite a bit. You prepare them as you eat them, which slows down the process, allowing you to feel more full. But they also require no heating and the additional prep time is minimal compared to many other meals.

What it would take to change my view:

1. An example of a better meal with similar or greater protein content and less than 400 calories that isn't too expensive

2. A specific reason why eating them every day would be unhealthy. Not just general concerns about processed food, but a specific ingredient or other factor.

3. Something else I haven't thought of

What won't change my view:

1. Subjective arguments about taste or repetitiveness. I enjoy the taste and actually prefer to eat the same thing every weekday.

2. Anything involving chicken. I already have chicken for lunch every day, and that actually would be too repetitive.

"Hello! I understand the majority of reddit feels quite strongly about vaccinations and I believe my view is the opposite of many of yours. I hope you go into this with an open mind and I will return the favor. 

The mandating of vaccinations would involve the government deciding what goes into a child's body. But I ask why shouldn't parents decide if they want to prevent something from entering their child's body? (Note: There is an argument to be made that parents shouldn't decide and the child should. However there are several important vaccinations that would occur prior to the child having the capacity to make such a decision. Polio Vaccine and Hepatitis B Vaccine come to mind. So either way someone is making that decision for the child. I believe that person should the parents or guardian - not the state.)

Why? Because parents are more so connected with their children than the government and therefore should be trusted to have their children's best interests in mind. Yes, sometimes parents are idiotic and make a health decision that is horrible and sometimes even fatal. However, the government has also been shown to not have the best health interests in its citizens at times. (See: Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment)


But at the end of the day, a parent not vaccinating their kids indirectly effects others. That has to count for something, right? Forcing vaccinations upon those who don't want it is for the greater good, right? Perhaps those thoughts are best summed up by Former Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., who once said, ""The right to swing my fist ends where the other man's nose begins."" I'm sure he would have supported a mandate, which will likely reduce the suffering of many people, wholeheartedly for this reason. But also for this reason he supported the horrific Buck v. Bell decision (a decision that unfortunately still has support, particularly on reddit.)

See. That's the problem with doing things for the ""greater good"", it often doesn't accomplish much and reduces the rights of others. 

A final point I'd like to make would be to highlight the parallel between vaccinations and smoking. Yes there are efforts to curb the activity in public places (In my own city of Pittsburgh, they recently banned smoking in bars.) However, smoking still effects more people than just the user. Second hand smoke is a real thing and damages a person's health when they had to choice but to breathe it in. Perhaps you could say that it is avoidable and being in contact with unvaccinated people is unavoidable. But secondhand smoke is practically unavoidable. It can stay in an area for hours - long after the overbearing smell is gone. You wouldn't even know. But yet there is no real support for a general ban on smoking as there is with a mandate for vaccinations. 


Just to cover my bases, I 'd like to say I'm not anti-vaccine. I fully support vaccinations, am fully vaccinated, and if I were to be blessed enough to have my own children, I would have them vaccinated. I view this as a freedom issue (right to body) and not a vaccines are bad issue. I thank you all for reading and look for to any possible responses.

"Whether employers admit it or not, one of the biggest hurdles for women wanting to get in jobs is the possibility that they may at one point get pregnant and have to leave work for an extended period of time, meaning the manager has to find a way to make up for the work the woman may have done, and have to pay them while they are away. This leads many people to have at least a small bias is the idea that hiring a man will be more permanent and a higher chance of more potential profit in the long run.

However, if the man who conceived the baby also got maternity leave, this would mean the risk is equal no matter what gender you hire. During maternity leave, the man would take care of the child with the woman, allowing for both of them to take care of the child, and allow the child to get more recognition of the father. 

This may also help stopping the idea that a women is necessarily the one who has to take care of the child, another stereotype that is often regarded as bad.

This could also theoretically help with rare events such as when male homosexual couples get a women (who would not raise the child) to birth the child for them given that they can’t.

This would ofcourse not solve all the problems with inequality in the genders, but I think this might be a good way to help (although since I’m posting it here, obviously I’m not /sure/ it’s a good idea)

"Little disclaimer: this deals with US laws and procedures so I apologize if anyone outside the US isn't able to contribute, except to tell me how great it is having this in their own country.

Last Sunday John Oliver's show dealt with this subject and chastised the US for being only one of two developed countries in the world without maternity leave that is paid for by the taxpayers. Here is a link to watch it if you haven't seen it yet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIhKAQX5izw

Here is the gist of my viewpoint:
In the US, when a person is terminated from a job, he/she is entitled to unemployment benefits for up to 99 weeks or until they are employed again. Workers and companies pay into this and, while many people end up taking more than they give, it is the system we have and it seems to work for the majority of people here. When a person leaves a job VOLUNTARILY, however, they are not entitled to unemployment benefits. If you quit a job to go to another job this is fine. If you are quitting to go 'find' yourself in Australia for a year, you better have a financial plan because you can't live off other peoples' money for your vacation. This system also seems to work well for most people.

In the US, abortion is Constitutionally protected under a person's right to privacy. The details of the laws vary from state to state but there is no place in the US where a person cannot legally and safely obtain an abortion during the first six months of pregnancy.

My stance is that if having a child is a choice, it should be one the parents must prepare for financially before making - just like if they wanted to voluntarily take time off work for other reasons.

We have safety nets for people who are caught in situations they can't control. This is not one of them. Being a parent requires the ability to plan and budget anyway, and it includes many expenses that people will absolutely incur that will not be covered by the hard work of others. It should start with planning to be off work for whatever time having the baby takes.

I completely support peoples' positions being protected while they are off and, quite honestly, think that length of time should be extended from 12 weeks to 24 weeks. But I REALLY don't like the idea of taxpayer dollars being used to support ANYONE who voluntarily leaves work - no matter the reason.

Change My View.

EDIT: I am also against he government mandating that companies provide paid maternity leave on simple Constitutional grounds. In the US the Constitution prohibits the government from mandating this. But I would LOVE it if companies started doing it voluntarily and think it would be a huge positive for attracting top talent. But it should be between employers and employees to figure out compensation packages.

Religion: This has been talked about endlessly, but I feel like many of the issues at least with the Abrahamic religions (the Crusades, terrorism, gay rights, etc.) comes down to a belief in an objective right vs wrong. Even though I've met plenty of Christians who actively question their faith and interpretation of the Bible, the Abrahamic faiths still come down to external rules that are at odds with human nature, particularly sexuality. Just look at how intrusive Sharia Law can be.

Science: While my teenage Atheist-leaning side of me would like to think that there is a huge gap between religion and science, science did arise out of Christianity after all, and its dogmatic leanings still show today. Here's a banned TED talk by Rupert Sheldrake(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKHUaNAxsTg) on a so-called ""science delusion"" (a play on the ""God Delusion""). While I do not agree with him entirely, I think he poses a very important point. The materialist worldview it has come to is very limiting compared to the original intent of the scientific method.

My view is that while we can be taught, it is up to us to learn through our own experiences and choose whether or not to accept the said teachings, as opposed to blind faith. However, I feel this is a dangerous view to have as it is not only is a rebellious one, but also heavily degrades my respect for the Abrahamic religions and a good chunk of the scientific community. I'd really like to see the other side of this.

"Psychics/tarot readers and other similar ""professionals"" practice a combination of hot and cold readings, techniques that are well known and understood by anyone who has a passing interest in this kind of stuff. If you're unfamiliar I suggest you look at the wiki entry for both (I'll link in a few I'm on my phone). In fact books that explain performing tarot readings are basically explaining how to do cold readings, but in veiled language. Practitioners may claim (or in some case even believe) they aren't using these techniques but that's because they unconsciously developed these skills from practice.

Im sure there are practitioners out there who believe they are helping others and giving advice in good faith, but I just don't see how that is ethical. They haven't had to training to give personal advice like a therapist would have recieved, and there's an uneven power dynamic between a mystic and a patron dissimilar receiving advice from a friend or family member. These are also professions that can possibly attract people with addictive personalities and become money sinks.

"There is an increasing trend in the UK of 'graduation' ceremonies for children leaving infant schools and primary schools (ages 7 and 10). A graduation was originally to signify the conferring of a certificate and to celebrate that milestone, and as such should be restricted to University courses, and at a push to cover people at the end of High School (so that the people who go straight into work celebrate an end of their formal education).

I appreciate that schools and the pupils want to celebrate the end of their time at that school, but placing children in garishly-coloured robes at the age of 7 only cheapens what a 'graduation' stands for. There are other ways they can celebrate a new beginning without appropriating and trampling on existing ceremonies and traditions

To give a comparison, consider how engineers in the US and Canada are given an iron ring in a ceremony to symbolise their obligation. The ring and the associated ceremony is a very personal symbol of their choices and achievements to the engineers. Now imagine how they would feel if every single infant school started copying their ceremony word for word, item for item, issuing iron rings to 7 year olds telling them it means the same.

My son is supposed to have a 'graduation' in a few months, and the vast majority of the parents are planning a boycott, organising their own event in its place. We can't even find out where this tradition started, or why.

"From a legacy standpoint, AJ is probably the least deserving amongst the figures on American paper currency (Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Hamilton, Grant, Franklin).  It's not like the guy didn't have good qualities or do good things while in office, but for a country that's trying to go in the direction of racial/ethnic inclusiveness, it's pretty baffling that the guy who's responsible for the trail of tears is on our currency.

That being said, I thought it was interesting to see in the news that people are trying to change who is on the $20 bill; however, Harriet Tubman seems like an odd choice considering the other possible candidates.  Off the top of my head, I think Teddy Roosevelt and MLK are the most deserving, and if I had to choose between them it would be MLK.  

Obviously, MLK's legacy speaks for itself, being the leader of the civil rights movement.  Compared to Tubman I just feel like MLK's impact was far greater.  His speeches and non-violent protests impacted the entire nation, millions of people, while Tubman saved ~70 people from slavery.  That's not to discredit Tubman because what she did was brave and important, and her accomplishments weren't limited to the underground railroad, but I think it's fair to say that MLK had a greater impact than Tubman, and therefore is more deserving to be placed on the $20 bill.  I might even go as far to say that it's not even close.

"Regardless of the man's less ethical actions, Andrew Jackson was known as the ""bank breaker"" and would've despised anything like the Federal Reserve. The Fed basically put him on the twenty to mock him. While his atrocities toward Native Americans are nothing to be proud of, I don't think we should be taking potshots with our currency. It's not like Jackson was a universally bad president either - in fact, he frequently breaks the top ten among historians, to this day:

"Batman's strict no-killing policy has lead to the deaths of hundreds of people. Normally I don't support vigilante justice, but at this point, Batman is obviously the only person who can stop the Joker. Additionally, it is obvious that Arkham cannot hold him. He has escaped countless times, and every time, Batman has to go recapture him (after he's killed or injured who-knows-how-many people). 

Ostensibly, Batman's no-killing policy is a self imposed check on his inner demons that he is sure will consume him if he gives into them. I believe that, in reality, he uses this policy as a security blanket he can cling to so that he doesn't have to get his hands dirty and make a difficult decision. I think he wraps up his own cowardice in a cloak of self-righteousness (albeit a fireproof, bulletproof cloak).

Here are my main views

1) The only way to stop the Joker is to kill or permanently incapacitate him

2) Batman has a moral obligation to kill or incapacitate the Joker since the state can't or won't do it.

3) He bares responsibility for everyone the Joker harms.

Important Points 

 The Joker is responsible for everyone he kills. The full burden of each person's murder is on his head. This CMV in no way negates his responsibility for his actions.

 Batman is not equally as responsible as the Joker for the people he kills. I'm not attempting to assign a specific amount of blame to Batman. All I am saying is that he bares some level of responsibility for his refusal to stop the Joker.

 Finally, Batman is not responsible for the people that the Joker killed early on in his career before it became apparent that he could not be contained. 

Edit

 If you are against capitol punishment or killing in general, we obviously have an unbridgeable gap here, and cannot possibly come to an agreement

 The only criminal that I am applying this argument to is the Joker. I'm not advocating for Batman to kill anyone else.

"Gender equality discussions in my eyes have reached a point, where all that happens is opression olympics. Every side has this one up mentality where everyone tries to be as much of a victim as possible, to make their statements somewhat count more or have more importance, while the other side tries to play down those statements.

I'd like to mention, that this all goes for middle class western society (most of what is reddits demography).

Here comes my problem: It seems to me, that both genders are trying to compare apples and oranges when it comes down to who has it worse. Its impossible. Both sides are so different from each other, both sides suffer from different problems both sides have different advantages. How could that be compared? Who decideds what problem is really worse then the other one? It can't be done. No human being has the ethical superiority to define which problem is worse. And its far more complex than just comparing two problems together. Its a huge set of things that has to be considered for each gender, and it is impossible to make an overall statement because of the complexity and variance between those two sides.

One big attribution to this kind of thinking is lack of empathy on both sides. Its simply to explain why this lack of empathy exists. Very few people get the actual living experience of both sides of this story, because normally people do not live as the opposite gender they are born as. So almost all people lack experiences of living as the opposite gender they are born as, and therefore have a very narrow experience on gender related issues. The typical grass is greener on the other side occurs.

What most forget, is how really different the living experiences of an average women is compared to an average men. I won't deny many of thoses differences exist because of some stupid cultural gender norms, but many do not. Many can be attributed to other stuff like biological imperatives. I am not saying that those contribute equally as hard to every individual, that is not true. Its a spectrum for everyone. But overall, the experiences differ between the genders, and thats why its a comparission of apples and oranges.

How can someone compare thoses difference experiences as a whole and say one is better and the other is worse? It can't even be done on an individual level, how is it possible to compare such huge groups as men and women?

I don't like the way the equality discussion is going, but i would be open minded to someone who can explain, why comparing men and women lifes is even possible.

I will try to argue against every statement that goes like: ""But look, gender x has it worse here and there and there, thats why they have it worse in general."" I will simply counter it with a list of disadvantages of the other gender, and ask you to compare what is worse. You will notice that it simply can't be done. If someone provides me happiness statistics, then i have some arguments against that too, don't even bother.

Tl,dr: Mens life and womens life are not comparable. Why can someone say one side has it worse than the other when there is no comparable ground?

"Okay so this requires a Trek-sized wall of text to even make par for a Trekkie ~~war~~ discussion. I'll break this into two parts to meet the sub's 500 character limit, part II being in the comments section:

Part I

Some people absolutely love TNG. For many, it’s their introduction to Star Trek. This makes no sense as even TNG’s writing staff have come forward complaining that Gene Roddenberry thoroughly tied their hands and forced the show to have zero conflict, zero drama, and to resemble his vision of a utopian future, by force mind you. Gene forced the staff, fans of TOS wishing to pay homage to the series, to create utopia against their will via his absolute authority as the creator (cutting out the influence of men like ~~Trotsky~~ D.C. Fontana or Gene Coon, and crowning himself grand chancellor or Star Trek). Let this be a foreshadowing to the sort of show that would unfold.

Even beyond it’s creation, if taken seriously as canon, TNG represents a dystopian future. Take the NCC-1701 Enterprise-D for example. The original Enterprise was just one of an historic line of ships, form the Earth seas to the stars. So why the Enterprise-D, with the same number and name? Why no other ship? Why no Constellation-D, or NCC-1700 Constitution-D? There is no other explanation: It was pure propaganda.","{'his', 'men', 'himself'}"
"I am an anarchist, to be specific, a Voluntaryist anarcho-capitalist.
Anarchism is the absence of government, the state. Voluntaryism is a political philosophy with two main points; all interactions should be voluntary by all parties, and everyone should abide by the non-aggression principle (people can not threaten, force, or coerce another person, for that is violent). 
To get it strait, I believe anarchism is only associated with chaos for the reason that the polar opposite of anarchy, the state, has been in power for thousands of years and is the ones to educate people since then.
I believe that the state itself is a hypocrisy; no man can be trusted to rule himself, so lets have someone from this group rule everyone.
I believe that taxation is theft on the grounds that they do not ask for your consent when they take your money, and is immoral no matter what the money is used for.
I believe that arresting is kidnapping, especially when it comes to lawbreakers, who I define as those who commit victimless crimes, compared to criminals who commit crimes with victims. To be honest, my views here are somewhat fuzzy.
Though I am absolutely not against learning and education, I am against state-based education. I find it violent through coercion. I or my parents could be fined or jailed because I want to take complete charge in my own education or just don't want to be educated in a place that indoctrinates patriots from an age where we can't argue well against it?
I do not believe that technological advancement will halt in any major way.
I do not believe that electricity, sewage, internet and the like will go away at all without government. Well, it's possible in a place where the government controls everything, but not entirely, I believe.
I am against the police because they have the legal right to kill you for what a couple documents say. People should only have the right to kill another individual as a last option in defense of yourself or someone else. No one should have the right to kidnap or kill you for a victimless crime. (Again, somewhat of a fuzzy area, especially when it comes to rapists or murderers.)
I believe that laws are nothing but threats. “If you do this, then we have the right to go as far as to kill you.” That sounds completely immoral, using threats to keep someone from doing something. 
I do not think people are any less safe in the long term if anarchy suddenly reigned on mankind. In fact, I believe that there will be a much stronger sense of community without a state, and a greater sense of protection.
I am sure I missed some points here, and I apologize if this seems too long. I tried to keep it short.

"I've been studying Linguistics as an undergraduate for about 8 months or so now, so this one is important to me academically. In discussions of language, there are typically two camps into which people fall: prescriptivism, and descriptivism. Prescriptivists, think your typical grammarian, David Crystal, Lynne Truss, etc., correcting people's grammar, getting fussy about punctuation, insisting upon proper pronunciation. At the heart of prescriptivism is the idea that there is a way that language should be spoken. Descriptivism, on the other hand, argues that there is no such thing as ""correct"" language, that what prescriptivists call ""mistakes"" are just non-standard varieties, and that we shouldn't ever make judgements about people's language.

Linguistics is whole-heartedly and almost exceptionlessly (AFAIK) descriptivist, and as a student, I recognise its importance. The view that there is any single ""correct"" variety of language is obviously misleading from the beginning: which variety? Who says X dialect is better than Y dialect? And judgements against language, I-believe-it-was-Peter Trudgill argued, are actually judgements against people's social class, as supposedly ""incorrect"" language features are often described by the upper classes as being used by the lower classes. And I do mostly agree with it.

But. While I understand all this, I find it difficult to truly shake off the claws of prescriptivism. In particular, the idea that there isn't any ""correct"" language. For example:

""He _went_ to the shops""
""He _gone_ to the shops""

I can accept that in some English dialects, the past participle of ""go"" is ""gone"" instead of ""went"". That's not a mistake. But then take a sentence like:

""Shops went the he to""

This isn't syntactically valid: it doesn't parse as a sentence. You might just be understood, but more likely you would confuse everybody with this sentence, so it fails as communication. If this sentence both isn't a valid sentence, and can't be understood, what other word to describe it than ""incorrect""? It can't be a valid form of language if almost nobody understands it, surely.

So what I'm really seeking, is to understand how sentences like the above can fit into the framework of descriptivism, and for someone to convince me that we can't describe sentences like the above as ""wrong"". Please VCM.

"Watching paint dry is a very simple thing. Going in you know what is going to happen, and you are just watching it unfold. There may be times of error, dripping of paint, or cracking, but in the end the wall is painted.

Game of Thrones is similar in that there is only one conclusion to the story, and while you may watch some of the paint drip, in the end you will see it dry and nothing else mattered.

In the first or second book/season in this series we learn that there is undead coming from the north to end the world. The only way to defeat them is unite the seven kingdoms and defeat them with dragons. This means that only one person can do this: Daenerys. Not a single other person has dragons. That mean there is only two possible conclusions to the Game of Thrones; Everyone dies, or Daenerys unites the kingdom and wins the war. I doubt anyone would bother with the story if the first happens.

This means there is only one conclusion to the story. Nothing else matters. Every other character is unimportant, and will die now, submit to the queen or die in the war. Every villain in the series will die and everything they do is meaningless, as the only evil is the undead. All the story lines will end before the final war with their conclusions being meaningless in the conclusion of the story. Who cares who is in power if we all know there is only one person who wins in the end? Therefore every minor story line has only one conclusion, they die or submit the queen, none of their goals of power can ever be fulfilled. There is only one person who can win or the world is destroyed. 

Just like the wall being painted, the story will end with a simple conclusion, all those cracks and drips are forgotten as the wall is done and they never meant anything. The wall is the white we painted it in the beginning and now it is dry, nothing else effected it in any way.

All watching the show is watching a long drawn out conclusion. Hell in the books, you can tell they made George add some other Targaryen, the once dead kid, because there was no mystery what so ever and no real reason to continue reading the books. People who watch the TV show are easy going, they did not need to add that mystery because people are content watching the paint dry.

Just like the paint, there is only one color, one ending, and one person who matters. Everyone else is just paint waiting to dry, never changing the known conclusion, just passing the time. Watching the show is watching these characters slowly dry the white you know they will with no mystery as there is only one possible conclusion. CMV

"Yes I'm an American male, and I don't know how things differ for women or those outside the United States, so I'll leave those two large groups out of the discussion. 

For any given American male, I believe the chances are less (possibly way less) than 50% that he will at some point in his life have a sexual encounter that truly fulfills his fantasies. I think this is due to a combination of factors, that when taken together hurt his chances greatly:

1) Most mainstream media (movies, TV, magazines, websites, porn, etc.) focuses on very attractive women (and men). Most people (maybe 80-90%) don't get anywhere near those standards. Yet the media offers what becomes, in many cases, the yardstick by which we judge attractiveness. This means the pool of attractive potential partners becomes smaller both for the guy and for those he has an interest in.

2) Many if not most men watch porn, and a lot (though certainly not all) of it glorifies unrealistic or demeaning things done to (generally) attractive people who are paid to do it and to act like they enjoy it whether they really do or not. A ludicrous amount of free porn is available to most people, usually from a young age, and much easier to access than an actual partner.

3) Lots of food, sedentary lifestyles, increasing obesity. This ties in with #1, in that we're taught that obesity is unattractive, yet people are getting fatter because of... lots of things, but we'll just say food is a business that's very heavily marketed to us, and usually not to keep people in good physical form.

I think this is a recipe for fat, porn-addicted dudes who dream of boning the hottest of the hot in ways that most self-respecting people would refuse. I'm sure some guys are lucky enough to have a truly gratifying experience with another person, but I think the majority will have to settle for something less than what they dream of. I think that's hard to argue against but also really depressing, so change my view.

"Hi! I'm trying to learn feminism -- which is a huge topic, and like all huge topics, has it's good and bad. I was recently introduced to the scathing disdain for the ""not all men"" sentiment. 

I'd like to start out by establishing a few things, because it's important to know that I don't support using this sentiment broadly.

1. Where a victim is grieving, confiding, venting, or however else they are dealing with a problem, it is an inappropriate time to use ""not all men"". The focus belongs on the victim and their healing at that time, not nitpicking their wording.
2. ""Not all men"", in the way I'm using it here, is actually ""not all X"", where X is any group in a discussion that has a broad, negative statement said toward their group. We see it most frequently thanks to the (most often deserving) scorn targeted at the ""not all men"" sentiment, but I do mean Not all X, where X is any group.

###The value of accurate language

As a young boy, when I said ""women are bad at math"", my father corrected me. He said ""some women are bad at math"". When my brother said ""you never let me go to town,"" he corrected him by saying ""I usually don't, but here are the times I did"". My father took issue with ""global"" language, as he called it, no matter what form it came in, because he saw it as harmful.

Have you ever felt a burden to prove you're some blanket statements that was often leveled against your kind? ""Women are bad at math"", or ""women cry so easily"", or ""blacks are stupid"", or ""feminist hate men"". For me personally, when I saw ""men are so shallow"" growing up I felt a sense of hostility from the statement. It felt like a judgement against me, and I felt like I had to carry the burden to show people that even though men are shallow, I'm a man and I'm not.

The point is, if we use careful speech, like ""I hate it when men are shallow / some men are so shallow"", OR ""It really bothers me a woman cries over the smallest thing"" and ""some women cry so easily"", we avoid creating broad, negative labels.  These labels can create a great sense of shame in the targeted group, and this shame fosters a sense of otherness. Instead of the shamed person feeling included or a part of something, they feel excluded. This, and the shame can also sabotage a person's self value and chance at success.

By biggest concern is the sense of otherness it can create, driving away potential allies, and by god we need a lot of allies to address the institutionalized racism and sexism in most western nations.

Therefore

1. I believe it is in the best interest of those seeking to address an oppressive culture to use accurate language in order to be inclusive to as many as possible, to maximize their efforts
2. Just as it is the responsibility of the privileged to not use broad, negative language to describe the oppressed, it's also (far down on the priority list) the responsibility of the oppressed to not use broad, negative language to describe the privilege. Because, really, it's a human's responsibility to a human to not use broad, negative language against a human. To a reasonable length, of course,  and I d not believe adding ""some"" before men, women, asians, etc, is much of a stretch.

###Picking an appropriate time

Again, the time to say ""not all X"" is not when a victim is trying to overcome their harm. But in casual conversation, as a small aside, it is good for all people to correct others when they use this harmful, broad language.

####Conclusion / TL;DR: No matter the group, broad language assigning negative traits to another group is harmful, and it is our responsibility as humans to take reasonable efforts to avoid propagating this harm, starting first with ourselves, second in mild conversation, and never while a victim is trying to overcome harm. We should never become comfortable using broad, negative language.

I'm 5'8, and rapidly losing my hair. 
I believe I will end up alone. I've only been in one long term relationship, where I settled for someone who wasn't very emotionally stable, this obviously was unhealthy and I had to leave her after 3 dramatic years.
Out of anger, frustration, and a hunger for change I have spent the last few years doing everything I can to maximize on every aspect of my life that I have control over. I dress well, have a good sense of humor and a very outgoing persona (I genuinely love talking to people), I also have one of the best competitive physiques I have seen from years of sports, intense weightlifting, proper training, eating and excercise. I've pushed myself so hard to develop habits that encourage me to be an honest, empathetic, and selfless human being.
I've read virtually every pickup and seduction book out there (while avoiding the disgustingly mysoginist side of that community), and have approached and talked to endless girls without fear (confidently and without anxiety) yet I am flaked on 100% of the time, every single time.

My increasing hair loss feels like a ticking time bomb for finding someone who will care for me enough to look past it before it goes or the Propecia I take kills my sex drive, as my short stature already turns girls away as it is.

Circumcision is really no different from the most commonly practiced form of female genital mutilation. FGM doesn't always involve the complete removing of the clitoris. It's not comparable to chopping off the head. There are four types of FGM. There is one type where the whole clitoris is removed, but others involve the removal of the clitoral hood, and others are comparable to the removal of foreskin. Circumcision supposedly lowers the risk of the contraction of HIV. The lifetime risk of HIV for men is 2%, and with the use of condoms, it can be 0%. If you get circumcised and still wear condoms... well.... what's the point? Now consider the risk of breast cancer for women, which is 12.4 percent for women born in the united states. Removal of the breast buds at birth could prevent this entirely, but nobody would actually want to do that.Just to clarify, circumcision for whatever medical reason as a child or later in life isn't nearly as bad. You can consent to it, and it's for a real health concern, unlike most cases with infant circumcision. An adult could choose to get circumcised if he wanted to. But does forcing genital mutilation on a baby for cultural or religious purposes make sense anymore? By definition, circumcision is mutilation, and in the vast majority of cases doesn't have any real health benefit. It's also not done for health, but cultural purposes in many cases.

I believe that most people should get vaccinated, and we should definitely persuade people to do so because they do cause more good than harm, but I am against mandatory vaccinations because 1) I believe it's an issue of personal choice and 2) I was harmed by a vaccine when I was very young, and I know a few people who were as well, and I think doctors need to stop pretending that all vaccines are entirely harmless.

A lot of the anti-vaxxers still perpetuate the myth that vaccines cause autism, which has been disproven several times. I have Aspberger's Syndrome and even I don't believe this anymore. Anti-vaxxers seem to have what is called confirmation bias, where they cling to their belief so much that any opposing arguments just do not register to them, and they will only bother looking at viewpoints that support their belief, because it makes them feel good. 

However, while pro-vaxxers tend to be a little better at acknowledging other points of view, a lot of them still have this mentality that anyone who questions the pharmaceutical industry at all must be an ignorant dumbass who doesn't know anything. This is simply not true. Since when is it wrong to question the intent of large businesses like the pharmaceutical companies? Now I don't subscribe to the anti-vax belief that these companies are trying to poison us or anything, but is it too far-fetched to say that since they are for-profit companies, making money does come first and foremost and effectiveness second? I'm not denying that they are expert scientists who are working to make them as effective as possible, but effectiveness sure isn't a requirement for them to make money. And since they can't get sued for any vaccine injuries, they have very little incentive to make sure their vaccines aren't causing any damage. The government is protecting them instead of protecting us.

Now regardless of how you feel about what I said above, you must admit that many of the pro-vaxxers can be extremely judgmental towards the vaccine skeptics, making heartless and cruel statements like ""Any parent who doesn't vaccinate their children should have their kids taken away from them."" Really? Let's break this down. You're saying that just because there's a small chance that an unvaccinated child will get some sort of disease, an even smaller chance that he will spread it to others before the disease is noticed, and an even smaller chance that the disease would be life-threatening, you think that's bad enough for a parent to be taken away from their children!? You think that's worse than people who smoke around their kids? Do you think parents who are bad drivers and could get their kids killed in an accident are any better? I'm sorry but unless a parent is beating or abusing their child, you have no fucking right to say whether that parent deserves to be with his/her kids. 

I have no problem with people telling others ""Vaccines are beneficial to society and I believe more people need to get vaccinated so we can get rid of disease."" But when you call people like me ""a walking disease"" and claim that I'm putting everyone at my school at risk every day just because I'm not vaccinated, I'm sorry but that's bullshit. Sure, there's a slightly higher risk of me getting sick but you can't act like it's inevitably going to happen just because I'm not vaccinated. Vaccinations aren't the only way of getting rid of disease. Look at this measles mortality graph from 1900. The vaccine definitely helped, but measles was on its way down before the vaccine as well. 

Another side note, I've heard that the United States currently has a more aggressive vaccine schedule than everywhere else in the world. I don't remember where I heard this. If someone wants to dispute this, be my guest.

My main two points are, 1) Anti-vaxxers do spread mistruths and lies about vaccines (which we can all agree on), but 2) pro-vaxxers over-exaggerate the necessity for vaccines, and unnecessarily shame those who don't get vaccinated as if it's the end of the world. I am neither pro-vaccine nor anti-vaccine. Please watch this video with Bill Maher, as it sums up my beliefs perfectly. As Marianne Williamson states in the video, ""There's a difference between having skepticism about science and having skepticism about the pharmaceutical industry."" 

I know this is a sensitive topic. Please don't comment by attacking me for my beliefs. Do not compare me to a climate change denier. I just want to have a civil discussion about this, and since I'll admit I still don't know much about the issue, I'm very open to learning more about science and vaccines. Educate me, Reddit! :)

"At the beginning of this year, multiple staff members at Charlie Hebdo were slaughtered in their offices. The reason for their murders were due to cartoons they published - satirizing the prophet Muhammed. Whilst the majority of people I've seen have been firmly in Charlie Hebdo's camp, there seems to be a noticeable backlash against Charlie Hebdo and some of the things they've done - to the extent that people have protested against PEN's (a freedom of speech organisation) decision to award them honours. I want to address some of these claims.

A Guardian article recently had this to say about CH:

The narrative of the Charlie Hebdo murders – white Europeans killed in their offices by Muslim extremists – is one that feeds neatly into the cultural prejudices that have allowed our government to make so many disastrous mistakes in the Middle East

First issue - this is a complete dehumanization of the staff who lost their lives that day. Suddenly, a murder becomes a narrative; that way, we don't have to see it as a crime. Furthermore, I imagine that Mustapha Ourad, copy editor of Charlie Hebdo, would be surprised to hear that he is white (if he were alive to hear it).

There are these claims that the writers at CH are racists (a claim that is demonstrably wrong, as I shall go on to explain), who oppress 'marginalized' peoples with cartoons. I suppose the people who make these claims either simply ignore, or do not see, the fact that the people who killed the cartoonists are very, very, very obviously racists themselves - demonstrated by their targeting of a Jewish community following the attack on CH - making them authentic, evidently racist killers. No one mentions that part of the 'narrative', do they?

The claim that CH is racist is an absurd one. I'll demonstrate why. Take this image from the New Yorker. Say you knew nothing of The New Yorker or wider US culture. What do you think this image conveys? That the New Yorker thinks Obama is a terrorist - that would be the only logical conclusion you could deduce.

The real purpose of that image is to parody the extreme right wingers of US politics and their claims about Obama - tea party claims that he is a terrorist, muslim, and unable to stand for presidency. To understand this, you require an understanding of current US political culture.

Now, take this widely circulated cover of CH's apparent racism(https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2925558/CHARLIE-HEBDO.0.jpg). It shows Boko Haram sex slaves shouting 'Don't touch our welfare'. Now, imagine you have no understanding of Frances wider political culture of CH. What do you think this image conveys? That CH is a racist, right wing magazine.

Now, if you did happen to possess an understanding of Charlie Hebdo and France's wider political culture; you'd immediately understand that the image is doing something extremely similar to the one on the New Yorker. It's parodying the extreme paranoia of the right wing, anti immigration parties that began to arise in France by displaying enslaved, pregnant, Boko Haram sex slaves invading France and taking their money.

Anyone with any understanding of French culture and CH know for a fact that CH is a left wing magazine that has routinely expressed their desire for immigrants to remain in their country, and that the rights of immigrants be respected. Ignorant people with no prior knowledge of parisian culture, of the history of CH, make these absurd, disgusting, disrespectful claims about CH.

'attacking marginalized peoples' - muslims

Firstly, if attacking 'marginalized peoples' is such a major issue - then their would be zero criticism, parody, or satire from the left aimed at the working class peoples who voted for the Tea Party, Ukip, of the French NF. Is that the case? If Tea Partiers, or the French NF, had gunned down CH - would their be claims that CH's vicious attacks on their ideology lay hold to the blame of the attacks? Would that argument be defended?

The people who argue this way must therefore agree that there is an Islamic blasphemy law that is enforced at gunpoint - regardless of whether a population wants it - and that you are to blame if you are slaughtered for saying something other people don't like.

Charlie Hebdo was a beacon of light, a welcome friend, and an invaluable ally to moderate and liberal Muslims across the globe. 

Islam

Islam has no special place. It should receive the same level of parody, criticism, satire, and insults that every other religion and ideology has - if not more so given it's followers reluctance to accept this. It's followers have no right to demand people not to write this way. Muslims have zero right to murder those who don't believe the same things as they do, or insult the things they believe. Muslims who support those who commit these murders are equally as disgusting and retched as those who commit them. 

but you shouldn't hurt peoples feelings!

You also shouldn't kill people. This is not an argument I take seriously - Islam needs criticism, parody, and satire, and muslims need to see it, in order to understand that in Western Countries, this is an important aspect of our culture. Islam is not above reproach, it is not above satire. The reason for the killings given doesn't even make sense anyway - Islam restricts muslims from drawing Muhammed. Non-muslims can draw whatever they want.

I understand there are people who do not agree with CH. I'm imploring you to explain to me why I'm incorrect in my support for them.

"Is this rape?

My ex-girlfriend got with a dude and he told her he loved her after a month and claims she thought she was in love with him, but really she was in love with me and trying to get over me. A month later she had sex with him twice because he told her he loved her.  After they had sex twice, he left her and completely stopped talking to her. She came crying to me saying she felt as if she was raped/sexually abused. I still care about her and I feel as if maybe that is a form of rape, but maybe not. It's not as if she was physically taken over, but mentally taken over. She was used for sex, but she consented to it, so I don't understand. Change my view.","{'he', 'him'}"
"Not really an opinion so much as a prediction, but its still a view i hold.  My prediction is based on a number of factors and you can address any or all of them or bring up new issues I haven't thought of.  

1) Unpopular: The draft for the war in Vietnam was extremely unpopular with massive protests and draft dodging.  After the draft was eliminated the protests died down even as the war continued.  It seems that America will support a lot of military activity (Iraq War 1 &amp; 2, Afghanistan, etc) as long as they are not personally forced to serve.  

2) No close border crisis: Other modern developed countries have forced selective service (South Korea, Israel) but usually these countries face bordering existential crises to their very existence.  America does not have this, has not ever had this, and presumably will not ever have this and so there is no need to have millions of men and women be conscripted every year for a tour of duty.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription

3) Nuclear Weapons: America may face small attacks here and there but no nation state large enough to possibly overthrow the United States government seems likely to attack for fear of nuclear weapons retaliation.  While 9/11 was a tragedy, there was no hope of terrorists taking over the country or overthrowing the government.  The only world forces strong enough to do this would be large nations with large militaries of their own and if they did have a mainland ground force invasion of US soil it would almost guarantee a nuclear response.

4) Women, and the out of shape:  This is a minor reason but none the less I'll bring it up for discussion.  In a modern draft there would be seemingly no way for women to avoid serving.  Currently women face demanding physical aptitude tests to qualify for the most demanding positions or in some cases are barred from service for fear they will not be able to handle the physical requirements of the job (front line combat, Navy Seals, etc).  In the 21st century when men and women have equal rights and are largely treated equally there would be pushback if those less capable of serving were thought to be more likely to get an easier or safer assignment.  This would create a race to the bottom for applicants seeking to avoid dangerous duty.  Furthermore the vast majority of Americans are overweight, out of shape, and would require extensive training to become combat ready.  If diabetes, heart conditions, obesity, or any number of conditions would disqualify a person from service I imagine people would quickly engage in unhealthy habits (or bribe doctors) in order to avoid service. 

5) Conscientious objectors: In previous generations there was a much stronger sense of duty, warrior culture, and sense of imminent danger which cultivated a value in service.  In the modern world, where people increasingly distrust their government, have more access to information, and are more likely to have diverse religious and philosophical views I do not see the public getting behind any major military involvement that would require a draft.  I would imagine there would be a rush to qualify yourself as a conscientious objector to the war in order to avoid combat even if that individual didn't feel that way immediately prior to the draft.  

Please change my view!",{'men'}
"A few months ago, Walter Lewin, a very famous physicist and MIT professor was accused of sexually harassing a female student in an online course. The MIT carried out an investigation and determined that he was guilty, cutting ties with him and revoking his title as an emeritus professor ( http://tech.mit.edu/V134/N60/walterlewin.html ). Now, I think we can safely assume that the accusations were real and I'll even concede that revoking his title is an appropriate measure. 

Nevertheless, I'd argue that the removal of his lectures is a nonsencial, knee-jerk reaction from the MIT to prevent any blemish on its reputation, perhaps from fear of criticism from certain groups. Maybe they thought that the harsher the measure, the better reaction they would obtain from the society.

Removing Walter Lewin's lectures is a non-sensical approach and can't be really justified. Are the lectures themselves sexual harassment? Of course not! Does this provide justice for the victim(s)? Not at all. This measure only makes it harder for students to access very good lectures that'll allow almost anyone to comprehend basic concepts of Physics. In fact, the lectures can be readily accessed through torrents or other webpages, so it's not like the MIT is ""erasing"" Walter Mit from the society just to provide some relief to victims or to protect their reputation.

Should we start destroying Wagner's recors just because he was an anti-semitic? Or should we stop referencing Watson's articles just because he made racist statements? I don't think so.

"Although I agree with many of his political stances, and hist critiques of the current system, I'm not entirely sure that he'd make a good president.  The way I see it, the job of the president of the United States is to represent the populous of the United States, and many of his more extreme views might appeal widely to a crowd on reddit, but are hardly representative of the entire political sphere of USA.   Even if he were to somehow win a majority vote, he would be as unpopular in the south as Lincoln was.

Furthermore, in order to get anything accomplished as a president, he needs to work fairly closely with Congress, and his current stance of ""attack anyone who receives donations from rich people"" would prevent him from being able to play nicely.   Finally, I think that as a president, his laser focus on the social problems of America would prevent him from focusing on the other issues that the president must contend with.  The way he presents himself currently, it seems as though he sees it as his mission to attack the current system, which is not the position that the president should occupy.    

Finally, as a 74 year old man, who will be 75 at the time of the election, I think the same critiques that applied to John McCain also apply to him - there's a fairly good chance that if he were elected, he would die, or become quite ill while still in office.  For these reasons, I think he'd be better situated trying to solve these social/political problems in a different capacity.

Edit:  I've seen a lot of the same points being brought up over and over again trying to refute my points, rather than offering evidence as to why he'd make a good president.   So I think I'll clarify:   I think that a good president is someone that unifies the nation, not someone that divides it, or enforces his will upon it.   ","{'his', 'he', 'him', 'himself'}"
